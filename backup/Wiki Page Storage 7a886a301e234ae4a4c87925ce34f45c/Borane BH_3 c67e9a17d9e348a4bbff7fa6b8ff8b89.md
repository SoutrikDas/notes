# Role : Electrophile

Since it does not have a fulfilled octet , it acts like an electrophile , 

The solvent [THF Tetrahydrofuran](THF%20Tetrahydrofuran%20c8917210d23d4c4ab1fec2f04e13b42e.md) somewhat stabilizes it , but Borane still acts like a electrophile . A pi bond is a site of high electron density, and therefore, a pi bond can attack borane. In fact, this is the first step of [Adding H and OH [atni-markonikov, syn]](Adding%20H%20and%20OH%20%5Batni-markonikov,%20syn%5D%20642356c60c614d329b21d774db9d0f8c.md)
