> The body may crave
sweets as the quickest way to get energy, but low-sugar, highprotein foods
and other nutritious fare work just as well (albeit more slowly)

Women have the same outburst that I have before relapsing , ie when I am devoid of any self control , and women have it in PMS , pre menstrual syndrome . 

During this void stage ( I am going to call the stage when you dont have much self control as void stage ) , one effective strategy that women use is to not be sociable , and not meet other people , ( which is what I have been doing almost all year last year , I was always in the void stage ? ) 

Another trick is : to use a sugar sweet as an emergency stopgap against the craving , but be aware that a sugar spike is promptly followed by a crash that leaves you feeling more depleted , So its not a good long term strategy .

Sleeping helps to recover self control but why ? 

From Bhante I have learned that 

- Willpower
- Understanding
- Reflection

Are the three things that help me have self control . 

~~But the latter two ( Understanding and Reflection ) work only when the former ( Willpower ) is not devoid , meaning when the situation is not as pressing .~~

In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8udDZDJSorM)  Bhante said that 

> Yes ( use willpower to stop yourself ) , if necessary. Understanding only works when things are not as pressing. 
( Willpower is unnecessary ) when understanding and reflection suffice .

The correct understanding would be : Willpower , Understanding and Reflection are these three variables $w , u , r$ , when either of them crosses a certain threshold ( let that be $T$ ) , I can say that I am seld controlled . But what bhante wanted to say ( or so I think ) is that more often than not 

$u+r<T$ ( meaning understanding and reflection will be less than threshold required to seld control or regulate ) so when these dont suffice ( ie If neccesarry ) then you have to use willpower .
