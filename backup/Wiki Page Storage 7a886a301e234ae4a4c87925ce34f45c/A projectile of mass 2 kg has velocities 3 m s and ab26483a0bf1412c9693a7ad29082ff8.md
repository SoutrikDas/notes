# A projectile of mass 2 kg has velocities 3 m /s and 4m/s at two points during its flight in the uniform gravitational field of Earth. If these velocities are perpendicular to each other then the minimum kinetic energy of the particle during its flight is ?

Let 3 m/s be $\vec u$ 

then the final be $(\vec u -tg \hat j)$ then 

$$\vec u \cdot (\vec u -tg\hat j )=0$$

$$u^2-tgu_y=0$$

$$u^2=tgu_y$$

We know $u^2$ is 9 , but we dont know either $u_y$ nor $t$ ??

Okay so the crux of the problem is that the horizontal component is same ( because no accel there )

and this horizontal velocity is going to be the only one alive at the highest point 

hence the minimum energy is 

$$\frac 12 mu_x^2$$

so we are getting 

$$\frac 1 2 \times 2 \times (12/5)^2=12/5$$
