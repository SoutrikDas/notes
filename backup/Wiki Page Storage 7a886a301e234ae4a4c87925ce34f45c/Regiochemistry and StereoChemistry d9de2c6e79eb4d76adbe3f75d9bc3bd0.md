# Regiochemistry

---

Rediochemistry refers to **where** the reaction takes place, in other words in which region of the molecule is the reaction taking place

This is an elimination reaction. The two possibilities are Zaitsev v/s Hoffman 

> Where does the double bond form? This is a question of regiochemistry

# Stereochemistry

---

Stereochemistry is all about configurations of stereocenters (R vs. S) and double
bonds (E vs. Z)

Usually you get the Zaitsev product, but under
special circumstances you can get the Hoffman product. If you use a strong, sterically
hindered base, you can form the Hoffman product.

## Stereochemistry in Elimination Mechanism is just Beautiful

Suppose you have this , and are asked to tell if the product is going to cis or trans 

![E_1%20v%20s%20E_2%20Elimination%20Reaction%20978a2721ce7147dca0d2cfc66a7114a6/Untitled%204.png](E_1%20v%20s%20E_2%20Elimination%20Reaction%20978a2721ce7147dca0d2cfc66a7114a6/Untitled%204.png)

First of all we want to know if it will go via E1 or E2 

- Secondary substrate =  E2 ( How do you know its secondary ? I mean it can also attack on the tertiary one no ? ) ( anything is E2 compatible but for E1 you need a 3rd degree , by 3rd degree I mean the carbocation has to be 3rd degree , here it is not , hence E2 )
- Strong ( unstabilized and $\ominus$ charged base ) = E2
- Good LG = Both

Hence it will go via E2 

Now what are the specialities of E2 ?

- Single step
- Rate depends upon base and substrate
- ⭐ E2 is stereospecific = Anti Elimination

Then your first question would be 

> But the Hydrogen is cis with the Chlorine , how the hell can there be anti elimination ??

And the answer is bond rotation / conformation

This is the beauty , the application of Newman figures .  I never thought this would have any use outside Isomerism chapter, but here we are !
