# Current Problems

---

When doing pushups I find my position breaking at the middle , meaning that I probably do not have much core strength . So I will try to train my core for the next two weeks 

the list of todo is like so 

Recap:
1. Russian Twist
2. T Stabilization L
3. T Stabilization R
4. V-Sit
5. Plank
6. Cross Crunches
7. Hip Raises
8. Glute Bridge
9. Plank Step-ups
10. Supermans
11. Bicycle Crunches
12. Heel Touches
13. Bird Dog
Time: 5 m 20 s per set (20 s per movement; 5 s switch position)
Total Time: 22 m per workout (16 m for 3 sets; 6 m for 2 rests)

Initially I wont be able to do 3 sets ,  heck I wont be able to do all of these excercises . But I will start with Russian twist , T stabilisation  (L and R) , Plank

# Basics

## SAID Principle and progressive overload

---

> Specific Adaption to Imposed Demands

if you can apply enough stress to the muscles and the nervous system through intense exercise, the body will adapt to this stress by improving strength and muscular hypertrophy-an increase in size of the muscles

- Progressive overload is the way to apply SAID principle

## Nomenclature

---

- **Repetitions(reps)** - The amount of repitition in a single step

If you perform 10 pushups in a row , before resting , that is a  *10 rep in single set*

- **Sets** - Sets are characterised by some number of *reps* and then *rest* in between
- **Rests** - Shorter Rest periods are typically better for endurance. Longer Rest Periods are typically better for strength.
- **Tempo** - The speed at which you execute Repetitions

Tempo is reffered to in a **ABCD** format 

- **A** - Seconds in initial movement
- **B** - Seconds held at terminal position

Sometimes there are only two numbers 

- **C** - Seconds in the counter movement
- **D** - Seconds held at the initial position before the next repetition

For example $**10x0**$

 

- **Intensity/Load**

This is a bit hard to grasph . Intuitively , I know that intensity means how difficult the activity is. But the way it is written and conveyed is a bit different. Because "Difficult" "Normal" "Easy" are very relative . But even then its very hard to draw a clear line . So we use the concept of **Repetition Maximum** 

**Repetition Maximum** ( 1 RM ) -

- The maximum amount of force you can lift in one repetition

Basically , we get tired when we do exercise , and that tiredness comes from two things 

The Load that we overcome in every rep . And the number of reps. For example overcoming a load of $90 N$ for $10$ reps and you cant do another single rep ( lets assume ) . Then the Repetition Maximum , is that amount of Load ( Let it be $x$ ) such that , you wont be able to do more than one repetition . 

- **Failure** - The point at which you cannot perform another repetition.
- **Plateau** - When an athlete on a specific routine has stopped improving their performance - whether in strength , endurance , hypertrophy , or other factors.

## Repetition Continuum

The strength is attained through low repetitions and heavier barrier 

Endurance occurs with high repetitions and lower barrier

It consists of **motor neuron**
