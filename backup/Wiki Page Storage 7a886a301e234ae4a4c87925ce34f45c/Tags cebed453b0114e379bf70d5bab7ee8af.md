    When I started out with this system , I thought about keeping the Relation and Tags to be complimentary to each other, therefore I was making to do the tag system be totally workable on its own , by having topics like `thermodynamics` and `kinetics` , but as I actually used this , I more and more became convinced that my setup works the best when both of them are interdependent and not complimentary. 

    So when To make a relation and when to use a Tag ?

    What is the purpose of a Tag and a Relation ?

    Its to categorise things. But then what is the difference ?

    Relations categorise according to the pages and tags to keywords.

    I think from that definition , Tags should be used when you have a lot of pages . BUT you can also use Relations no? Make a new Page and Bam . But then why use relations ? Maybe to point something out aside from the tag ?

    For example If I have a tag `kinetic` and if I have the Page `Kinetics` I would be able to provide more information along side categorisation ( ie I can provide more info inside that Page alongside the Page acting like a tag )

    So why not remove all tags and just use Pages? Well not all tags need to really have Pages, for example `physics` , Its understandable what that tag is about, you dont really need a full page to define/ provide information. 

    But Tags cannot have Parents. Pages Can Have parents . Well Even if it does have a parent , what Use is it ? Unless its a Topic Page . Well If its a topic page , then it probably shouldnt be a tag!

# Rules of Conduct

---

- If you are not sure Its going to be used → Use Pages in the beginning and later if the amount increases , make a tag for it .
- If you are not sure if it will need an explanation → Use pages in the beginning and later if you need an explanation , then keep it like a page . If later you feel like it doesnt really need any extra information and is self explanatory → Change it to a tag
- If you are sure It wont need an explanation → Ask yourself if it will be used at all ? Even without an explanation , if a Tag is only applied to Very few pages , Its better to use a Page Instead

According to the rules of conduct , we need to have a `number` , ie , If our Page that doesnt need explanation exceeds that number of childs , then it will be converted to a tag . But for that we need to measure how many pages on an average does a tag connect . 

I believe We can decide on that number later on , let me clean the tags first

# What is oos ?

Its out of syllabus  , yes , But my syllabus is always changing right ?

Does this tag have any use ? Probably not , at the present moment , its connected to mostly Blender Problems 

Verdict: OOS is useles 

But before deleting them , is there any other appropriate tag I can give it?

The blender ones have Blender as their parents  , so they wont have any problems.

# `Doubt` and `Doubt Cleared`

---

Do I really need two explicit tags for it ? 

I mean Can I not use `Doubt` and `Cleared` ( which is again two tags ) but the `Cleared Can have Different meanings when used with other things , like ? Question Papers ( `question` `cleared` ) or ( `question paper` `cleared`)

I dont really think its a good idea , because I seldom finish anything like question papers ( matter of fact I only attempt to do what I couldnt ) 

So What are the Rules and Guidlines for using `Doubt` and `Doubt Cleared` ? 

Should Every question that has a `Doubt Cleared` have `Doubt` in the first place ?

You cannot mass edit rows that have some different and some same tags . If you do however , then all of them will have the same final Tag.

Do I really need a Doubt ? I mean Doubt is so restrained to only `questions` , maybe a bit more like `unclear` , which I can apply to even certain topics that I am learning ( Having a `Unclear` would be better than a `Doubt` wont it? )

# Is there a need for `Chapter` ?

---

Why is there a need ? The thigns I marked with chapter are supposed to be big and bulky text containing material . But not all Bulky Text Containing material are Chapters right ? What differentiates them ? 

For a Bulky page to be a `chapter` , it needs to have theoretical knowledge , uh what ?

What if Blender has a lot of theoretical knowledge , will I be able to call it a chapter ? 

Well , A better Definition for a `chapter` would be 

> A Page that has a lot of information

But that definition wont be able to hold up. especially for cocurricular like gatsby , d3 ( when they become big ) 

How about this 

> `Chapter` is a big body of text that is study related

But what do you mean by study , I mean The meaning of study will change as I progress through life . So what exactly do these mean ? 

# Do we need an `unfinished` and `unclear` ?

---

The unclear part , I dont think I use much 

The unfinished however , I dont think needs to be used , because almost everything is unfinished , Its the agile way of doing things, finish a shippable code , and iterate and improve . So its never really finished

Hence the tag `unfinished` is going to be deleted

About the `unclear` tag , I feel like I sometimes have pages ( topics ) where I feel a little bit dizzy or unclear , or not confident , but is it useful to mark them as unclear  ? I mean If I try to remember about a topic , I can easily gauge my understanding. I dont really need this tag. Even If I filter anything out using the unclear, It would be like this 

![Tags%20cebed453b0114e379bf70d5bab7ee8af/Untitled.png](Tags%20cebed453b0114e379bf70d5bab7ee8af/Untitled.png)

Which , I dont really feel unclear about.  Honestly, for Addition Reactions , I might have felt unclear at some point , But I reiterated and improved and maybe my doubts decreased 

I am going to delete `unclear`

Should I keep the `adv` tag ? Although I believe It should be made in to a page tag because there arent many pages with it , but still , there are a good few with it . Let this be for now.

## Recordable

would be a nice thing to categorize by , But it doesnt have that many pages , for now it has one . Let me create a Page tag instead.

## `aiml` `data science` will be sorted out later Jan 2, 2021
