# A mass m and another mass 10m are connected with a string , there is sufficient friction to prevent the slipping of 10m. What is/are the condition for complete circular motion of mass m

So for the minium velocity case scenario , the final energy of $m$ should be almost zero at the highest point , because almost all energy was used to go up there.

So the two equations we get are 

First equation from the fact that ~~in boundary case~~ , the centrifugal would be totally balanced ( This is not just true for boundary case but always )

$$mv_f^2/L=mg$$

The second equation we get from Work Energy Theorem 

$$W_g=\Delta K\\
-mgL=K_f-K_i$$

We do not know $v_i$ but we have an equation for $v_f$ 

$$mv_f^2/L=mg$$

$$v_f^2=gL$$

PLugging this into the work energy theorem 

$$-mgL=\frac{1}{2}m(gL)-\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2$$

$$-2mgL=mgL-mv_i^2$$

$$v_i^2=gL+2gL=3gL$$

So the initial speed ( minimum ) is 

$$v_i=\sqrt{3gL}$$
