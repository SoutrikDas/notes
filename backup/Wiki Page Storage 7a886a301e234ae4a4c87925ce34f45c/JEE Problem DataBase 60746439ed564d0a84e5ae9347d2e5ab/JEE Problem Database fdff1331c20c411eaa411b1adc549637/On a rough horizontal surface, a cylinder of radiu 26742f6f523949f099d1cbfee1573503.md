# On a rough horizontal surface, a cylinder of radius R and a cube of side 2R is kept ust in contact as shown in the figure. A constnat horizontal force F is applied on the cube such that the line of force passes through the center of cylinder. The coefficient of friction between the bodies and the floor is \mu<1 while friction is absent between the two bodies. The mass of both the bodies is m

For the first option , The maximum friction force for the cylinder is $\mu mg$ and the maximum friction force for the cube is also $\mu mg$ so the maximum force such that they are still in equilibrium should be $F_{max}=2\mu mg$

Since the two bodies dont have any friction where they are touching , the cylinder indeed can roll. 

But one constraint is that , since the cylinder recieves the force from the cube , it has to always be in contact with the cube , meaning they will have same acceleration

The condition is that the cylinder rolls , which probably means that the cylinder purely rolls , ie 

$$a=\alpha R \tag2$$

And the only torque acting on the cylinder is the friction 

$$\tau=\mu mg R$$

Since we know $\tau =I\alpha$

$$\alpha=\frac{\tau}{I}$$

A cylinder is just a like a disk elongated in another direction so their moment of Inertia is same 

$I=\frac{mR^2}{2}$

$$\alpha=\frac{\mu mg R\times 2}{mR^2}$$

$$\alpha=\frac{\mu \cancel mg \cancel R\times 2}{\cancel mR^{\cancel2}}$$

$$\alpha=\frac{2\mu g}{R}$$

Now using Equation $(2)$ 

$$a=R\alpha $$

$$a=R\frac{2\mu g}{R}$$

$$a=2\mu g$$

Now using Equation $(1)$ we get

$$F-2\mu mg=2ma \tag 1$$

$$F-2\mu mg=2m(2\mu g)$$

$$F=6\mu mg$$

So the acceleration of the cube ( which is $a$ ) 

Now the options are given in terms of $F$ 

Lets write them down 

- C :  $0.4(F/m - \mu g)$
- D : $0.2(F/m-\mu g)$

Lets simplify the terms in the bracket , 

$$\frac Fm -\mu g=\frac{6\mu mg}{m}-\mu g=5\mu g$$

So we can write the options C and D as 

- C :  $0.4(5\mu g)$
- D : $0.2(5\mu g)$

But what did we get ? We got that $a=2\mu g$ , so which one of these options are same as our answer ?Option C is same as our answer .
