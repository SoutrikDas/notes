# A stick with mass m and length wR is pivoted at one end on a vertical wall. It is held horizontal and a disc with mass m and radies R is placed beneath it, in contact with both it and wall as shown in figure.The coefficient of friction between disc and wall is \mu_o, between disc and stick is \mu_s. System is released and it does not fall.

If there was no rod , then the case would be like this

So the friction between the rod and this round object stops the object from rotating .

So we can find the two torques and equate them , for the round object to be in equilibrium

~~Assuming the frictions are maximum~~ 

So the friction between the wall and the ball , balances the weight of the ball and the bar 

$$F_w=mg+mg=2mg$$

Now lets take the point of attachment of the ball and wall as A . Torque due to the weight of bar and ball at A is 

$$\tau_1=2mgR \hat k$$

Torque about A due to the friction force is 

$$\tau_2=-F_bR \hat k$$

Since we know when there is no angular acceleration , the external torque is zero , therefore 

$$\tau_1+\tau_2=0
$$

$$2mgR=F_bR$$

So Friction force of the wall is also $2mg$ ? Okay. 

So in the minimum case of $\mu_s$ , we want the $\mu_s$ to be small but also able to produce a friction of $2mg$ 

So 

$$F_b=\overbrace{\mu_s(mg)}^{\text{only in boundary condition}}=2mg$$

$$\mu_s=2$$

And for the boundary condition of $\mu_o$ , we want it to be small but also be able to produce a force of $2mg$ , 

$$F_w=\overbrace{\mu_o\underbrace{N}_{\text{this is equal to $F_b$}}}^{\text{only in boundary condition}}=2mg$$

$$\mu_o(2mg)=2mg$$

$$\mu_o=1$$
