"A stick with mass m and length wR is pivoted at one end on a vertical wall. It is held horizontal and a disc with mass m and radies R is placed beneath it, in contact with both it and wall as shown in figure.The coefficient of friction between disc and wall is $\mu_o$, between disc and stick is $\mu_s$. System is released and it does not fall.",
"On a rough horizontal surface, a cylinder of radius R and a cube of side 2R is kept ust in contact as shown in the figure. A constnat horizontal force F is applied on the cube such that the line of force passes through the center of cylinder. The coefficient of friction between the bodies and the floor is $\mu<1$ while friction is absent between the two bodies. The mass of both the bodies is m",
"A cycle wheel contains 24 spokes of 0.5 m length , It is rotated in horizontal plane with 120 revolution /min in the effect of earth magnetic field. If total magnetic field of earth is $10^4 G$, then dynamic emf accross center and rim of the wheel ( angle of dip is $30\degree$)",
"A mass $m$ and another mass $10m$ are connected with a string , there is sufficient friction to prevent the slipping of $10m$. What is/are the condition for complete circular motion of mass $m$ ",
