# A Thin Spherical insulating shell of Radius R carries a uniformly distributed charge  such that the potential at its surface is V_o. A hole with a small area \alpha 4 \pi R^2 (\alpha <<1) is made on the shell  without affecting the rest of the shell . Which is correct ?

Options are 

1. The potential at the center of the cell is reduced by $2\alpha V_0$ 
2. The magnitude of electric Field at the center of the  shell is reduced by  $\frac {\alpha V_0 }{2R}$
3. The ratio of the potential of the center of the shell to that of the point $\frac 12 R$ from the center towards the hole will be $\frac{1-\alpha}{1-2\alpha}$ 
4. The magnitude of electric field at a point , located  on a line passing located on the line passing through the hole and the shells center, on a distance $2R$  from the center,   of the spherical  shell will be  reduced by $\frac{\alpha V_0}{2R}$

So what are we given ?

- It is insulating , so charges dont move
- $\frac{kq}{R}=V_0$ So $q=\frac{RV_0}{k}$ , this is the amount of charge on the surface
- $\sigma=\frac{q}{4\pi R^2}=\frac{RV_0}{k4\pi R^2}=\frac{V_0}{4\pi Rk}$
- When making a hole , we remove a certain charge , so if we bring that amount of charge back , with the negative of it , then we are not disturbing the system ( Just like negative mass in COM ) , So the charge we bring back will be $\sigma \times \alpha 4\pi R^2=\alpha q$
- So the potential of $-\alpha q$ on the center will be the decrease , and it is $\frac{-k\alpha q}{R}=-\alpha V_0$  , so the first option is wrong
- Initially there was no electric field at all , because it is a hollow sphere , so magnitude can never be reduced , so the second option is also wrong
- What is the potential of the center ? $V_0 -\alpha V_0$ or $V_0(1-\alpha)$ , and what is the potential at $1/2 R$ ? For the positive part , its going to be $V_0$ but for the small negative part , the distance is halved , so potential is doubled , hence $-2\alpha V_0$ , so net is $V_0(1-2\alpha)$ , Hence the third option is correct
- So the point  ( in the 4th option) is R distance away , so its potential will reduce by the same amount , but its not the potential we are talking about , we need the field

- So we just need to find the magnitude of the negative part , which is going to $\frac{-\alpha k q}{R^2}$ so $-\frac{\alpha V_0}{R}$ , hence the fourth option is also wrong
