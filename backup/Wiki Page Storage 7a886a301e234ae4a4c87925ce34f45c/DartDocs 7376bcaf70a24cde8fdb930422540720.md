# Download Dartdocs

---

```dart
flutter pub global activate dartdoc
```

and also http for the search function 

```dart
flutter pub global activate dhttpd
```

Add the path  `C:\src\flutter\.pub-cache\bin` to your PATH 

and then to make the documentation , just go to the project root directory and run `dartdoc`, this will create some html pages inside the folder `docs/api` inside the root directory of the project

To view it after its created , use `dhttpd --path docs/api` and then go to `https://localhost:8080`

# How to document

---

First of all , use  the triple slash comment for dart doc

```dart
/// these types of comments are dartdocs 
// not these
```

Use the Brackets to link to different things 

```dart
/// A domesticated South American camelid (Lama glama).
///
/// Andean cultures have used llamas as meat and pack
/// animals since pre-Hispanic times.
class Llama {
  String name;

  /// Feeds your llama [Food].
  ///
  /// The typical llama eats one bale of hay per week.
  void feed(Food food) {
    // ...
  }

  /// Exercises your llama with an [activity] for
  /// [timeLimit] minutes.
  void exercise(Activity activity, int timeLimit) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

In the generated documentation, [Food] becomes a link to the API docs for the Food class.

and the way to do doc comments is like 

```dart
 /// first line will be a summary 
 /// 
 /// Now the details will start from the third
 /// line after keeping the second line empty 
```

For now I havent figured out if there are seperate ways to document class and functions , the above example just tells us to document it over the class definition or function definition

# Add code snippets in doc comments

---

```dart
/// Returns the lesser of two numbers.
///
/// ```dart
/// min(5, 3) == 3
/// ```
num min(num a, num b) => ...
```

# Add links to variables , functions , or type names  in docs

---

If you surround things like variable, method, or type names in square brackets, then dartdoc looks up the name and links to the relevant API docs. Parentheses are optional, but can make it clearer when youâ€™re referring to a method or constructor.

```dart
/// Throws a [StateError] if ...
/// similar to [anotherMethod()], but ...
```

To be a bit more specific , you can link to a specific member of a class 

```dart
/// Similar to [Duration.inDays], but handles fractional days.
```

The dot syntax can also be used to refer to named constructors. For the unnamed constructor, put parentheses after the class name:

```dart
/// To create a point, call [Point()] or use [Point.polar()] to ...
```

## Significance of the one line gap

---

so for a comment like this 

```dart
/// Mywidget has age and a button
/// 
/// It doesnt take in any params but it has an 
/// [_MyWidgetState.age] variable 
class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget {
...
}
```

what exactly does the one empty line do ?

![DartDocs%207376bcaf70a24cde8fdb930422540720/significance_of_the_empty_line.gif](DartDocs%207376bcaf70a24cde8fdb930422540720/significance_of_the_empty_line.gif)

So the first line is shown as a summary and if you want to see more , you can click on the `[...]` and get to see the next lines after it 

# Add Images in documentation

```dart
![alternate text if theres no image](<image url>)
```

the exclamation mark is the most important thing , if you dont give it , then it will just be a link
