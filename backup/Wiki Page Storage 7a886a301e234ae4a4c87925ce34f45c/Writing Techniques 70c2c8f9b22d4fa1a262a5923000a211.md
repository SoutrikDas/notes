This is a page where I compile avoidable faults from many books

## Instead of Long Paragraphs, state the points in a (bullet) list.

Replace this 

![Writing%20Techniques%2070c2c8f9b22d4fa1a262a5923000a211/Untitled.png](Writing%20Techniques%2070c2c8f9b22d4fa1a262a5923000a211/Untitled.png)

with this 

- compounds written over or under the arrow are sometimes stoichiometric reagents, sometimes catalysts, and sometimes just solvents
- organic reactions are often not balanced
- the product written on the right side of the equation is usually the product that is obtained after aqueous workup (add water)

## When introducing something new , that you want the reader to Remember its better to repeat it the next time you reference it.

Grossmans's Rule is a rule introduced way earlier into the book 

![Writing%20Techniques%2070c2c8f9b22d4fa1a262a5923000a211/Untitled%201.png](Writing%20Techniques%2070c2c8f9b22d4fa1a262a5923000a211/Untitled%201.png)

although an easy rule , but we didnt remember this rule ALONG with the name of Grossman's rule so it becomes a bit hard to remember from the name.

But later in the chapter when he references it , I didnt remember it . If he just wrote a small definition in bracket in the next picture , there would be less resistance to proceed

A concept I saw in Tariq Rashids book called , " Make your own neural networks" is to Take a concept that you are trying to expain to a student , and then boil it down to the least possible bit ( which can be intuitively understood ) 

Then build up why some modifications has to be made , to come to the modern version 

For example , How Tariq initially starts with the very easy to understand , one input one neuron 

Without any weights

Then he showed multiple inputs without weights ( his reason was that one neuron is linear , so to model something that is non linear you have to simply add more neurons , and our own biological brain is layered , hence this network ) 

He creates an easy understandable base , then slowly builds up from it , BUT by giving intuitive and easy to understand reasons . If the reason is not easy to understand then break it ( for example if we went from un weighted single neuron to weighted muti neuron , it would have been a bit too difficult , but his reasoning was to break those two , and slowl transition ) 

He also used pictures to portray that he feels us

This kind of creates a sympathetic connection between the reader and the writer , that the writer understands the reader, it developes a kind of trust. 

## Writing mathematical formulas by hand makes it easier to read

![Writing%20Techniques%2070c2c8f9b22d4fa1a262a5923000a211/Untitled%204.png](Writing%20Techniques%2070c2c8f9b22d4fa1a262a5923000a211/Untitled%204.png)

This is much much easier to read but obviously not feasible for daily notes . It reduces the barier for the reader ( especially if the reader is not so mathematically astute ) 

These kinds of cluttering of math formula make it hard to read
