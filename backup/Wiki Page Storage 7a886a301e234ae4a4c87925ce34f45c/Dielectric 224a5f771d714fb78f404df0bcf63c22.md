## Definition of a dielectric

---

> A dielectric is a non-conductor up to a certain value of the field depending upon its nature. If the field exceeds the limiting value called dielectric strength, a dielectric loses its insulating properties and begins to conduct. -"BM Sharma"

- What is dielectric strength ?

    The maximum electric field that a dielectric can withstand without the occurence of a breakdown is called its dielectric strength.

# Types of Dielectrics

---

1. Polar Dielectric 
2. Non Polar Dielectric

# What is the difference between dielectrics and Conductors ?

> The similarity is that under the influence of an electric field , both of them try to nullify that electric field . But the conductor ( if disconnected ) is able to fully nullify , but dielectric is only partially able to nullify

The main difference is that 

- A dielectric does not have free charge carriers
