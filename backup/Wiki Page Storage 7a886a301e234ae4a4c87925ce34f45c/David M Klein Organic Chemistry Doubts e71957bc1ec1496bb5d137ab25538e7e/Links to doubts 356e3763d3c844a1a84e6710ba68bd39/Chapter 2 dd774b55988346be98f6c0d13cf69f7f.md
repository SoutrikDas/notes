Chapter-2**Klein chapter -2**

Chapter-2:Molecular representations

Q.1. Why are triple bonds drawn straight unlike single and double bonds?

A.

Q.2. How is formal charge possible as in how can an atom have more electrons than it’s octet? As in what is the quantum mechanical meaning of this happening?

A.

Q.3. What is difference between acylic and cylic compound?

A.

Q.4. A brief description of humo and lumo in molecular orbital theory?

A.

Q.5. What does it mean for an atom to have orbitals? for example we say second row elements can’t have more than eight because they don’t have enough orbitals.. what does this precisely mean?

A.

Q.6. Why can electrons from double bond only resonate to allylic positions of a double bond?

A.

Q.7. In page 76, klein says the structure C having octet and more covalent bonds is the more stable one, why is this so?

A.

Q.8. Why are structures with least formal charge the most stable for resonance?

A.

Q.9. When atoms resonate, the lone pairs may move from an atom to a double bond or vice versa, This changes electronic configuration of atoms. So because of this how do we decide the vsepr geometery of atom?

A.
