# All hybridized Orbitals form only $\sigma$ bonds

Because each hybridized orbital forms its own INA (inter nuclear Axis ) so it can only form $\sigma$

## No of Sigma bond $\sigma$ → Hybridized Orbitals

## No. of Pi Bonds $\pi$ → Un Hybridized Orbitals

So first you check how many electrons you need to leave from the right side and then hybridize the remaining orbitals on the left side . 

But why do we leave the outer most electron to form a $\pi$ bond? Is it because outermost can easily form $\pi$ bond and the inner one cant ?

Why do the orbitals even need to have the same energy
