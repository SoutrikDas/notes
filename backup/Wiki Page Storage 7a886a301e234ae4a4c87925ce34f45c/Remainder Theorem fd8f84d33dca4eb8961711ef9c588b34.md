Statement : if Polynomial $f(x)$ is divided by a linear function $(x-k)$ then the remainder is $f(k)$

# Proof

---

Suppose on dividing $f(x)$ with $(x-k)$ then we get $Q$ as the quotient and $R$ as a remainder 

$$f(x)=(x-k)\times Q+R$$

Now put $x=k$ 

$$f(k)=\cancel{(k-k)\times Q}+R$$

Therefore $f(k)=R$
