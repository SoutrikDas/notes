So if we have a function of 3 variables $f(x,y,z)$ then grad of f is defined as 

$$\nabla = \begin{bmatrix}
 \cfrac{\partial}{\partial x} \\
\cfrac{\partial}{\partial y} \\
\cfrac{\partial}{\partial z} 
\end{bmatrix}$$

$$\nabla f=\begin{bmatrix}
 \cfrac{\partial f}{\partial x} \\
\cfrac{\partial f}{\partial y} \\
\cfrac{\partial f}{\partial z} 
\end{bmatrix}$$

You can think of this as a Vector Field . The arrows Point to the direction you should walk to go to the highest point
