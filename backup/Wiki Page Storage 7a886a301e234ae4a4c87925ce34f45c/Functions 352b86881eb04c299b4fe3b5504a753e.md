# How to check if a function is `one-one` and/or `onto`

## How to check if a function is `one one`

---

There are a few methods ( [as stated here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/101975/how-to-determine-if-a-function-is-one-to-one) )

- Take $x_1$ and $x_2$ and let $y_1=f(x_1)$ and $y_2=f(x_2)$ . Now either start with $x_1=x_2$ or $y_1=y_2$ then end up at the other one, to proove its a one one
- Or you can start with $x_1 ≠x_2$ and then go on to prove $y_1 ≠y_2$ or vice versa
- Or you can take the derivative of a function . If its always negative or always positive ( it means if it increases , then it keeps on increasing. Thus no two $x$ have the same $y$ ) then its one one.

### What is `one-one` ?

The following image is a `many-one`

The following image is a `one one`

So how do we check if one input is being mapped to one output only ?

WE take $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that $y_1=f(x_1)$ and $y_2=f(x_2)$ . And then check what will happen if $y_1=y_2$ ( Because if the output is same , the input should be same too - thats another way of defining the `one one` )

So the condition is 

$$y_1=y_2$$

And from that , if we get $x_1=x_2$ then wallah ! Its a one one . But If we get $x_1 ≠ x_2$ then it will probably not be a one one function ( since two inputs $x_1$ and $x_2$ map to the same output $y_1=y_2$ )

# How to find the range of functions ?

For example

$$f(x)=\frac{x}{1+|x|}$$

So for mod functions , you take different cases 

For $x≥0$ the function becomes 

$$f(x)=\frac{x}{1+x}$$

Whose range is ?
