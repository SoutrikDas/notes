# The potential energy of a particle of mass m at a distance r from a fixed point O is given by V(r)=kr^2/2, where k is a positive constant. This particle is moving in a circular orbit of radius R about the point O. If v is the speed of the particle and L is the magnitude of its angular momentum about O, which are correct ?

what is the dimension of k ? 

Potential energy is energy , $\text{Force x Distance = Distance$^2$ x k}$ , its , Force /meter , 

What can the relation be between potential energy and Kinetic energy ? 

Are they equal ? There is no reason to say that 

Maybe , we can bring the particle from $O$ to $R$ distance , and that will cause an increase in potential , but well , Kinetic energy would increase if potential decreases . 

But Kinetic + Potential =constant , only when force is conservative no ? 

But work energy theorem states that , Work done by forces ( conservative or non conservative ) will contribute to a change in kinetic energy 

Any way I can find out work from that potential function ? I do know that 

$$F=-\frac{dU}{dr}=-kr$$

OH , I see 

So at $R$ , the body will have a centripetal force 

$$F_R=-kR$$

The $-$ doesnt really matter , the magnitude matters 

This centripetal force can also be written in terms of $v$ like so 

$$\frac{mv^2}R$$

Equating these two 

$$mv^2=kR^2$$

$$v=\sqrt{\frac km}R$$

option B is correct

We know angular momentum is given by 

$$L=m(\vec v \times \vec r)$$

But here since everything is perpendicular , we will just multiply 

$$L=m \sqrt{\frac km}R^2$$

$$L=\sqrt{mk}R^2$$

option C is correct
