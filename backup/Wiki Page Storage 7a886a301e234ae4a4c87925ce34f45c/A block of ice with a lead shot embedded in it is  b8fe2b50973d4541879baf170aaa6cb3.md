# A block of ice with a lead shot embedded in it is floating on water contained in a vessel. The temperature of the system is maintained at 0\degree C as the ice melts. When the ice melts completely , does the level of water rises

at the beginning the ice of lower density with a lead shot ? why is there a lead shot ? anyway 

- $\rho_1$ is the density of Lead
- $\rho_2$ is the density of ice
- $\rho$ is the density of water at 0 degree ( $\rho > \rho_2$ )
- $V_1$ is the volume of lead
- $V_2$ is the volume of ice
- $A$ is the area of the base of vessel

Now initially let the height be $h_i$ , Now lets put the ice and lead shot and see how much water they displace 

$$V_{w1}\rho g=(V_1\rho_1+V_2\rho_2)g$$

$$V_{w1}=\frac{(V_1\rho_1+V_2\rho_2)}{\rho}$$

So how much does this increase our water level by ? 

$$\Delta h_1=+\frac{(V_1\rho_1+V_2\rho_2)}{A\rho}$$

Which means if we take them away , we get 

$$\Delta h_2=-\frac{(V_1\rho_1+V_2\rho_2)}{A\rho}$$

$\Delta h_1$ is kind of useless because our starting case is when the ice is already floating , 

Later when the ice has melted , the since mass of ice is conserved through state change , we can say that 

$$V_2\rho_2=V_x\rho$$

So the volume of water added is 

$$V_x=\frac{V_2 \rho_2}{\rho}$$

and the lead shot also falls into water , so the net volume water displaced / added is 

$$V_{netadded}=\frac{V_2 \rho_2}{\rho}+V_1$$

now this will cause 

$$\Delta h_3=+\frac{\frac{V_2 \rho_2}{\rho}+V_1}{A}$$

So net total , we are getting 

$$\Delta h_2+\Delta h_3 =+\frac{\frac{V_2 \rho_2}{\rho}+V_1}{A}-\frac{(V_1\rho_1+V_2\rho_2)}{A\rho}$$

$$\Delta h_2+\Delta h_3 =+\frac{\frac{V_2 \rho_2}{\rho}+\frac{V_1\rho}{\rho}}{A}-\frac{(V_1\rho_1+V_2\rho_2)}{A\rho}$$

$$\Delta h=\frac{V_1\rho+V_2\rho 2}{A\rho}-\frac{V_1\rho1+V_2\rho_2}{A\rho}$$

$$\Delta h=\frac{V_1\rho-V_1\rho_1}{A\rho}$$

$$\Delta h=\frac{V_1(\rho-\rho_1)}{A\rho}$$

Now $\rho$ was density of water at 0 C amd $\rho_1$ was density of ice at 0 C 

and water is more dense at 0 C than Ice , hence $\rho>\rho_1$ 

There fore 

$$\Delta h=+ve$$

Water level rises
