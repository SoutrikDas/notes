# Projection Formulas

## Wedge Dash

---

This one is by far the simplest 

- Wedge - ( Solid ) - Coming towards you
- Dash - ( Not solid , dotted line ) - Going away from you

The dotted lines mean that you do not have a clear line of sight of that molecule , whereas the solid wedge line means you have clear sight of the molecule 

## Fischer Projection

This is a bit complicated form ,But here is a gif to show what it does

But the question that comes up is , its messing with the conformations ! Yes true  , its messing with the conformations , but ( probably ) twisting the conformations doesnt change the configurations , hence it preserves the configurations

## Newman Projection

# Conversion from one to another

## Wedge to Fischer

## Fischer to Wedge-Dash

all formulas are Written like this

And when you COnvert them , they kinda become like this

### Wrong Fischer Transofrmation

![Projection%20Formulas%20bfd5d251a3e749a6b197a25f05fee687/Untitled.png](Projection%20Formulas%20bfd5d251a3e749a6b197a25f05fee687/Untitled.png)

This does not mean this 

![Projection%20Formulas%20bfd5d251a3e749a6b197a25f05fee687/1.gif](Projection%20Formulas%20bfd5d251a3e749a6b197a25f05fee687/1.gif)

It means this
