The admission process was hectic , most of which was handled by my father , he made a well structured heirarchy of folder and documents , 

But after all was done , we were supposed to be given the email and password. and withing 24 hours of the last date of registration ( which was 22 Novembor ) , we should have received an email regarding my student email or such , but today is 24 , and Yet no wind of it .

Desperate for answers ( and thinking that the format of the email was given on the registration page ) I [asked on quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-format-of-student-email-of-IIT-ISM-Is-it-admission-number-iitism-ac-in-This-format-was-mentioned-in-the-registration-form-but-I-did-not-take-note-of-it/answer/Sakub-Nair?ch=3&share=7049fa78&srid=Yjgk) for answers and sure enough , the format was given , it was 

$$\overbrace{\text{20je0971}}^{\text{Admission number}}@\overbrace{\text{cse}}^{\text{branch}}.\text{iitism.ac.in}$$

This is the application form having important but not necessarily private information

# So where exactly will this email be used ?

---

are you going to go to [google.com](http://google.com) and press log in and use this email and password ?

The answer is no. 

Then where will you use this email ?

This email can only be used when you are inside the campus ( ie when connected to intranet ) , and why would you do that ? Because it has all ( or almost all ) information about yourself , for example your education status , what percentage you got in which year , you can also ( probably ) choose your room mate after one year , it also has notifications regarding intern notification , etc etc. 

> In short , your email id ( `20je0971@cse.iitism.ac.in` )  and password ( initially default password is your registration number , which you can change later ) is the key to accessing your student Dashboard that is full of information about you

But wait , Your email is only useful if you are on the intranet right ? Then what about when you are not connected to the intranet ? How do you log in or do any student related activities ? 

The answer to that is the [parent portal](https://parent.iitism.ac.in/index.php/parent_portal/portal0) where you dont need your email ( but thats only because your email is made up of your admission number , and you need your admission number for parent portal ) 

Here is how it looks

But problem is , they should have already approved my student account , but when I try to log in , I am unable to .
