# Convert from Wedge Dash to Chair

---

The crux of this part is to understand the terminology of up and down.

![Conformations%205f13674452cc40b09aa295427df9feaf/Untitled.png](Conformations%205f13674452cc40b09aa295427df9feaf/Untitled.png)

Now consider an up down in the chair format 

![Conformations%205f13674452cc40b09aa295427df9feaf/Untitled%201.png](Conformations%205f13674452cc40b09aa295427df9feaf/Untitled%201.png)

Now just number the initial wedge dash compound you had

Then number the chair

Then check which one is down and which is up ( for 1-3 its different than for 1-2 )

And you have it

Here is an example

# Ring Flip

---

**A ring flip is NOT this :**

![Conformations%205f13674452cc40b09aa295427df9feaf/Untitled%206.png](Conformations%205f13674452cc40b09aa295427df9feaf/Untitled%206.png)

This is a ring Flip :

![Conformations%205f13674452cc40b09aa295427df9feaf/Untitled%207.png](Conformations%205f13674452cc40b09aa295427df9feaf/Untitled%207.png)

When performing a ring flip, all axial positions become equatorial, and all equatorial positions become axial.

If a substituent is up, then it will stay up all of the time, throughout the ring flipping
process. ( in both the above images , CL is down ) 

Here is a beautiful video on Chair flip that truly shows how the equitorial converts to axial

But then if ring flips do happen then what about those question that asked us to make the most stable chair configuration ? it would ring flip and suddenly they are in a totally different position ! 

Given a figure like this : 

![Conformations%205f13674452cc40b09aa295427df9feaf/Untitled%208.png](Conformations%205f13674452cc40b09aa295427df9feaf/Untitled%208.png)

We can deduce two figures , both are connected by a ring flip 

![Conformations%205f13674452cc40b09aa295427df9feaf/Untitled%209.png](Conformations%205f13674452cc40b09aa295427df9feaf/Untitled%209.png)

One is very very stable and the other is not so stable , BUT the cyclohexane keeps flipping back and forth between these two conformations ( it probably spends more time in the more stable configuration and less time in the less stable configuration )

# A -Values

The OH is less bulky than CH3 , so if you ever had to make a decision of whom to put on the axial positoon , you would chose OH ,

This measure of sterics is made through some values called A -Values
