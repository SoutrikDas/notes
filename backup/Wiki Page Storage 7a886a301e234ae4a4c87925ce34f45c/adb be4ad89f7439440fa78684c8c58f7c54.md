Open two command prompts

check if the device is connected 

```dart
adv devices
```

If it is open the shell on one cmd 

```dart
adb shell
```

This gives you access to some of the files of the phone 

THen use `cd` and `ls` to get the path of the thing you want , for example 

```dart
sdcard/DCIM/Camera/IMG_20201016_105712.jpg
```

Then go to the other cmd , and use this command to pull this file to Dekstop 

```dart
adb pull sdcard/DCIM/Camera/IMG_20201016_105712.jpg C:\Users\Soutrik\Desktop
```

The general command is like this 

```dart
adb pull <file path on phone> <path where file will end up on windows>
```
