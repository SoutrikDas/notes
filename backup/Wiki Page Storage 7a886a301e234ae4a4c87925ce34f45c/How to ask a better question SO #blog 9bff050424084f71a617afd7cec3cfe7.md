So I was banned from being able to ask questions on SO , i thought i was contributing to the community but I guess not , I looked back and almost all my questions had a net negative vote , one line that struck with me is that 

> asking questions is a privilage not a right

the fact that you will treasure something after its taken from you , happened to me. but thats only because I have never had the context of " I may be banned from asking questions " 

anyway , what do I do now , I probably have to scourge a lot of articles and then go through my questions to find out what was going wrong .

# Help Vampires - Amy Hoy

Who is a help vampire ? these are the person who suck spirits from well intentioned person by asking them for help.

## How to identify a help vampire

---

- Does he ask the same, tired questions others ask (at a rate of once or more per minute)?
- Does he clearly lack the ability or inclination to ask the almighty Google?
- Does he refuse to take the time to ask coherent, specific questions?
- Does he think helping him must be the high point of your day?
- Does he get offensive, as if ***you*** need to prove to ***him*** why he should use Ruby on Rails?
- Is he obviously just waiting for some poor, well-intentioned person to do all his thinking for him?
- Can you tell he really isn’t interested in having his question answered, so much as getting someone else to do his work?
- Ask impossible question (" how to make a forum ")

## How to change ?

---

1. **Keep troubleshooting**. Often we learn that it’s easier to give up and ask for help rather than persisting—when we’d get our breakthrough if we’d only delay giving up for another 10 minutes. Respect yourself, go a little further before giving up.
2. **Google**, of course. Google partial error messages, add software names to your queries, and generally try at least **3 or 4** searches before you give it up as hopeless.
3. **Mailing lists, forums, and newsgroups**. Chances are, you’re not the first person on the Earth to have this problem. Luckily we live in an age where we can search the past. Check out these resources next.
4. **Docs**. Sometimes they seem impenetrable, but give it a whack. The more you learn, the easier the documentation will be to understand and decipher.
5. **Ask your question—but phrase it differently**. Instead of asking your question directly, ask “Has anyone has seen this problem?” or “Can anyone point me in the right direction?” Likely as not, someone will have been there before, and they might know a blog posting or other resource which can help you out. This way, you show you are respectful of their time, and understand your problem is (probably) not unique.

When you do ask a question, try to provide as much background detail as possible. Ask yourself these questions first, so that others don’t have to:

- What **version** of the software are you running?
- What’s your **operating system**?
- What exactly are you trying to do that won’t work?
- Is the problem uniform or erratic?
- What’s the exact error message?
- When did it arise?
- What exactly don’t you “get”?
- Can you provide sample code, ideally with **line errors where the error occurs**?

# How to ask good questions ?

---

A question has in stack overflow has two parts the body and the title , and both are very different 

## What makes a good title ?

---

- Pretend you are talking to a busy colleague and you are in need of help but have to summarize everything in a sentence so that they can help you
- Spelling, grammar, punctuation are important
- Write the title last ( ie after writing the body )

## What makes a good body ?

---

- introduce the problem in words before giving any code

I dont think anything will come of editing my questions because they are out of context now , I was becoming too dependant on stackoverflow , now that I dont have it I have to live without it .

but sometimes , when I would want it , I will obviously come back and try to edit my questions with the hope that they lift the ban , but I have to understand , stack overflow is not all , there are resources that I never looked deep enough to find , I have the oppurtunity to improve my answers question and everything . but not all is lost , I can still check stack overflow for questions .the thing is I have to let go of all hope to get back to asking questions in stack overflow .
