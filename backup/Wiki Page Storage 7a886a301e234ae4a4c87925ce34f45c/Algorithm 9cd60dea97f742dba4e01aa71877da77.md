This page is going to be used for everything I learn about Algorithms 

Which means anything from the book is going here. But how should I manage the content ? Like Even if its from a book , later I am going to learn from other sources 

Matter of fact , I have another original Database [Competitive Programming Problems](Competitive%20Programming%20Problems%200f1f69d1e31045769f6f4e46f5ce06b0.md) 

To store the doubts that  I have in codeforces and such websites.

I think I should have a list of Algorithms and for now use them as Page Tags , and provide the description in this page , and as the content grows, move over respective sections to each Algorithms own page . And since it will be two original databases , I would want there to be a connection. ( Or should I make them one table ? )

## Modular Arithmetic

$$(a+b)\%c=(a\%c+b\%c)\%c$$

But why !? Lets see if its even holds up for a=7 b=13 and c=5

LHS=0 , 

RHS= $(2+3)\%5=0$ . Okay so it does hold true
