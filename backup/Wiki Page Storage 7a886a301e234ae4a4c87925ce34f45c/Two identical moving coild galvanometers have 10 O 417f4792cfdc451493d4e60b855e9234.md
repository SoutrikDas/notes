# Two identical moving coild galvanometers have 10 \Omega resistance and full scale deflection at 2 \mu A current. One of them is converted into a voltmeter of 100mV full scale reading and the other into an ammeter of 1mA full scale reading using appropriate resistors. These are then used to measure the voltage and current in the ohms law experiment with R=1000\Omega by using an ideal cell

# Converting Galvanometer to Voltmeter

---

For this we just need to add a resistance in series 

$R_s$ 

such that when maximum current passes through , the net potential drop accross is = $100mV$ 

$$\overbrace{2 \times 10^{-6}}^{current}\times \overbrace{(R_s+10)}^{Resistance}=10^{-1}$$

$$R_s=5000-10=4990$$

But all in all , the resistance of the voltmeter will be $5k\Omega$

option A is incorrect

# Converting Galvanometer to ammeter

---

Here we need to make the load of the current pass through a shunt resistance , so that our galvanometer doesnt get burnt to a crisp 

So the current that passes through galvano meter is

$$\frac{R_h}{R_h+10}I_{net}=2\times 10^{-6}$$

$$\frac{R_h}{R_h+10}\times 10^{-3}=2\times 10^{-6}$$

$$1000R_h=2(R_h+10)$$

$$R_h \approx 0.02 \Omega$$

So option B is correct

# Option C

---

Doing the Ohms Law Experiment , what even was the ohms law experiment ?
