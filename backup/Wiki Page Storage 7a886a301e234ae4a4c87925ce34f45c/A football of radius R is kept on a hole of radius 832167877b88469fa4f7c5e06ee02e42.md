# A football of radius R is kept on a hole of radius r (𝑟 < 𝑅) made on a plank kept horizontally. Oneend of the plank is now lifted so that it gets tilted making an angle 𝜃 from the horizontal as shown inthe figure below. The maximum value of 𝜃 so that the football does not start rolling down the planksatisfies (figure is schematic and not drawn to scale)

So how are we going to do this ? 

Okay so as we increase theta , why should it roll down at all? The torque is provided by weight .

So when is that point when its just about to fall?

What happens at this point really ?

If we define $\phi$ and $\theta$ like so , then the condition for `just going to fall` is 

 

$$\phi = \theta$$

Which means we should find the tan , sin , cos of $\phi$ 

$$\tan \phi=\frac{\sqrt{R^2-r^2}}{r}$$

$$\sin \phi =\frac rR$$

$$\cos \phi=\frac{\sqrt{R^2-r^2}}{R}$$

So option A is the only correct option
