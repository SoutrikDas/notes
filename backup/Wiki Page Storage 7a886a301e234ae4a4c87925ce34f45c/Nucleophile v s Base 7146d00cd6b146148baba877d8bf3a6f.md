# In [$SN_1$ v/s $SN_2$](SN_1%20v%20s%20SN_2%204d48c13a75404f07b9626959d2aec8d9.md) We ranked Nucleophiles on the following basis :

- No charge means weak Nucleophile

- Charge but stabilized  means good Nucleophile  ( Halogens with negative charge are very stable )

- Charged but unstabilized means excellent Nucleophile

    # In [Acid Base Reactions ](Acid%20Base%20Reactions%20593773d95a39437db5cfe95b27604de4.md) we ranked bases by judging their conjugate acid , using the four factors

    1. Atom 
        1. In the same Row , it depends on Electronegativity ( $\ominus$ on Oxygen is more stable than Nitrogen )
        2. In the same Column , it depends on Size ( $\ominus$ on Oxygen is less stable than on Sulphur )
    2. Resonance
        1. The more delocalized the more stable the conjugate acid ( benzyl is better than allyl  because more delocalization ) 
        2. But delocalization with  One oxygen is better than many carbon atom

    3. Induction
    4. Orbitals
        1. Sp Orbitals are more closer to nucleus hence stabilize it and hence conjugate acids with Sp are more stable than conjugate acids with sp3 or sp2
        2. But $\text{NH}_3$ being sp3 is more acidic than alkyne ( with terminal hydrogen ) which is sp

# Combining both system of rules

1. When comparing atoms in the same row of the periodic table, basicity and nucleophilicity do parallel each other

    For example lets compare $NH_2 ^\ominus$ and $OH^\ominus$ 

    $OH^\ominus$   will be more stable , therefore $NH_2 ^\ominus$ will be both a better Nucleophile and a better base 

    In same row , Nucleophilicty and Basicity are similar , they depend if the compund is unstable or not ( actually they check if the compound is less electrophile or not , because less electrophile it is , the less it can stabilize the charge , hence more unstable eg  $NH_2 ^\ominus$ vs $OH^\ominus$ ) ( if unstable then better base and nucleophile )

2. When comparing atoms in the same column , for eg $SH^-$ and $OH^-$ 

We find that $SH^-$ is more stable because it has a bigger size , hence $OH^-$ is a better base 

But since Nucleophilicity is about speed ( kinetics ) while basicity is about stability ( thermodynamics ) , **an effect occurs that makes large compounds like** $SH^-$ very good nucleophiles 

> As the sulfur atom approaches an electrophile (a compound with ), the electron density within the sulfur atom gets polarized, meaning that the electron density can move around. This effect causes the sulfur to be drawn to the electrophile very quickly, so the rate of attack is very fast.

Conclusion is that the more polarizable becomes nucleophile ? 

**Bottom line:** sulfuwr nucleophiles will function as nucleophiles and not as
bases. For the same reason, halides (Cl, Br, I, which are all very large and very
polarizable) will also function as nucleophiles and not as bases.
