This electron should have gone to the right but due to the energy given out from the chemical reaction it gains enough energy to oppose the electric field ( and to complete the circuit)

This is where the bags of electrons are filled with energy , which it then goes to the resistace and empties its bag!

**EMF** is the potential diference b/w the cell **when the circuit is open ( Current =0)** 

What bettery claims to give is emf , but what it actually gives is terinal Voltage

If one of the cells is Reversed then simply put -E1 instead of +E1
