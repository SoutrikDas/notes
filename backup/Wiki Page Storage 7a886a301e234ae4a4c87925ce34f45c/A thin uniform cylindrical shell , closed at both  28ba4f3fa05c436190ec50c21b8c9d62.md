# A thin uniform cylindrical shell , closed at both ends, is partially filled with water. It is floating vertically in water in half submerged state. If \rho_c is the RD of shell then relation between \rho_c and water level inside is ?

- $V_c$ is volume of shell
- $\rho_c$ is density of shell  relative to water , so actual density is $\rho_c \times \rho$
- $A$ is the area of the base of the cylinder
- $l_w$ of the length of water column inside the cylinder

Using the archimedes principle

$$( l_wA)\rho g+V_c\rho_c\rho g=\overbrace{\frac {l}2A\rho g}^{\text{given that it was half submerged}}$$

$$l_w+ \frac{V_c\rho_c}{A}=\frac l2$$

Now what is the relation between $V_c$ and $A$ ? 

$$V_c=2\overbrace{\pi R^2}^{A}dt+2\pi R\times l\times dt$$
