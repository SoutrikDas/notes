Motive , to go from benzene to Benzene with a propyl ( not iso propyl )

Since fridel craft alkylation has carbocation rearrangement , we do not get a single product

But since Fridel Craft Acylation has a intermediate that does not go through carbocation rearrangement

and then somehow convert that ketone to propyl

and that is what we are going to be doing
