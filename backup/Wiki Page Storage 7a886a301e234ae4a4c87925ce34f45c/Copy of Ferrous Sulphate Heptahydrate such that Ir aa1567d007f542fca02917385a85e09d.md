THe question doest say that $FeSO_4.7H_2O$  is of 10 ppm in 100 kg of wheat . 

It says that $FeSO_4.7H_2O$ has some mass , it has some ppm , due to which Iron $Fe$ has 10 ppm in $100kg$ .

Now if we think that $100kg$ is a million part , then each of our individual part would be $\cfrac{100,000}{1000,000}g=\cfrac{1}{10}gram$ So 10 parts is $1g$ . and for 1 gram of Fe We can say there is $\cfrac{1}{55.85}$ moles of $Fe$ which means there are that many moles of the salt ( ferrous sulphate heptahydrate ) So weight of the salt = $\text{weight of 1 mol of salt } \times \text{no. of mols of salt }$ 

$$\cfrac{1}{55.85} \times ( 55.85+32+4*16+7*18)=4.97$$
