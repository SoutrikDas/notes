Reaction Coordinate has nothing to do with time

## In a energy v/s Reaction coordinate what can we say when two objects are closer v/s when they are far apart ?

The question is "**what can we say when two things have almost similar reaction coordinate ?**"

and the answer to that is , **if the reaction coordinates of two things are near , then they LOOK ALIKE** , because reaction coordinate basically defines the geometry and bonding 

Here in this image , B is closer to A in terms of Reaction coordinate , so B **LOOKS LIKE** A

## What information can we get from the Reaction Coordinate Diagrams ?

- The number of steps/intermediates in a reaction
- The relative Energies of Reactant , Product , Transition States and Intermediates ([Transition States and Intermediates are different](https://www.notion.so/Intermediate-v-s-Transition-State-1393c38934a44043b5d38e701918b3e0) )

## What information can we NOT get from the Reaction Coordinate Diagrams
