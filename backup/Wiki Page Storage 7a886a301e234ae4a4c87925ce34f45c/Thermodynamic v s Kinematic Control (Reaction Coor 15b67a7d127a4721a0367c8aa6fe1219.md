### If multiple products are possible for a reaction then the ratio of the products are dependent on two factors

- Relative Energies of the TS- Kinetic Control
- Relative energy of the products  - Thermodynamic Control

### In the First Reaction

- Kinematic Control product ( faster product ) = A
- Thermodynamical control product ( stabler product ) = A

So Because Kinematic and Thermodynamics both favour A we can say A will be the major product in any Condition ( low temp or high temp , low time or high time )

 

### In the Second Reaction

- Kinematic Control (faster) Product = B
- Thermodynamical control product = A

Here there is a conflict , Kinematics say B but Thermodynamics says A .

Now we can **exploit** this conflict by helping one of them to win so that we can get our desired product . WE can do this kind of manipulation by changing 

- Temperature
    - If you have less energy then its easier for you to climb a shorter mountain - Kinetic Control
    - If you have more energy then its easier for you to climb a larger mountain - Thermodynamic Control
- Time alloted for the reaction
    - If Time alloted is very less ( ie manual stopping of reaction or [having a strong base](https://www.notion.so/Thermodynamic-v-s-Kinematic-Control-Reaction-Coordinate-Diagram-15b67a7d127a4721a0367c8aa6fe1219#634f2de087454234bca801b8d1443bb8) ) then only the faster product will be available in abundance
    - If a Long Time is alloted then slowly but surely the more thermodynamically stable product will form .
- Bulki ness of a Base

If you use a bulky base then you will make it harder to form the thermodynamically stable product (By raising the Barrier Energy ) so essentially you are obstructing the Thermodynamic Product , but in doing so you increase Ratio of Kinetic : Thermodynamic in favour of Kinematic

- Stron Base

In the presence of a strong base , the reaction goes very quickly  , therfore having less amount of Time
