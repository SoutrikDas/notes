# From Blender documentation [here](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/grease_pencil/properties/layers.html#layers-list)

> Any stroke can only belong to a single 2D layer.

> There is always only one active layer in the list (the selected one). When you draw, the new strokes are added to the active layer. By default the view order of the layers in the viewport is top to bottom.

Duplicating strokes from a layer make the layer assign to the new (duplicate) object
