So I believe the steps are like this 

- ~~Import the pdf somehow to make it a 3D object ( maybe texture it )~~  I took a screenshot of it
- use that as a image texture on a plane

Add some lighting

Then make a mesh that has transparent material , and animate it using a boolean to appear smoothly

Someone else said about using dynamic paint in blender

Although the result is way off from what I wanted , atleast I have a basic highlighting effect , but it can be improved with dynamic paint .
