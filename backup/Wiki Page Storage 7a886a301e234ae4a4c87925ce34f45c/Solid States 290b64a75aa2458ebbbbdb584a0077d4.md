# Classification of Solids

[Classification of Solids ](Solid%20States%20290b64a75aa2458ebbbbdb584a0077d4/Classification%20of%20Solids%202e9f1dd7be6e46f4a8b3c32998969dab.csv)

## Ionic Solids

---

## Metallic Solids

---

## Molecular Solids

---

London Dispersion Forces can hold these molecules ( These molecules are held together by covalent bond ) under conditions of low temperature

![Solid%20States%20290b64a75aa2458ebbbbdb584a0077d4/Untitled.png](Solid%20States%20290b64a75aa2458ebbbbdb584a0077d4/Untitled.png)

Since the holding forces are london dispersion forces , the bigger the electron cloud , the stronger the force hence the more the melting point ,

Which means $Cl-Cl$ has lower melting point than $I-I$ 

## Covalent or Network Solids

---

# Types of Intermolecular forces

---

Intermolecular forces are weaker than Intramolecular forces ( intra means those forces that hold a molecules contents , for eg : covalent bond ) 

- Hydrogen bonding
- Ionic Bonding
- Ion Induced Dipole Forces
- Ion dipole Forces
- van der waals forces
    - London Dispersion Forces

- Wikipedia says that covalent bonds are intramolecular because they join atoms to form molecules , but Ionic Bonding is Intermolecular ? Dont they join for ex Na+ and Cl- , Are they molecules too ?

- Induced Dipole - Induced Dipole  - London Dispersion Forces
- Permanent Dipole - Permanent Dipole  - Dipole Dipole Forces
- Permanent Dipole - Induced Dipole

## London Dispersion Forces

---

These are induced dipole induced dipole forces ( basically the force between $\delta ^+$ and $\delta ^-$ of a induced dipole ( which was induced by luck , randomly ))  , check [here](https://youtu.be/5OT5l-NZS24)

The strenght of London Dispersion forces depend on Polarizability → more Large Electron Cloud ( which is generally found in higher molar mass atoms )

The result of this is Argon have higher boiling point than Helium , because Argon is more polarizable because it is bigger 

Conclusion : 

- Higher Molecular mass → Larger Electron Cloud → More Polarization →Higher London Dispersion Forces
- But if the molecular mass is same , ie Same Electron Cloud , then You need to see the surface area exposed , more surface area exposed → more interaction →more polarizability [Which has more  Surface area ? n-Butane or IsoButane ?](Which%20has%20more%20Surface%20area%20n-Butane%20or%20IsoButane%2061d59ef3a96c49d888d60ff1936c9772.md)

## Dipole Dipole Forces

---

When one permanent dipole ( acetaldehyde ) interact with another permanent dipole thats called Dipole Dipole Forces 

that is why Propane ( Mol mas 44 ) has very lower boiling point that Acetaldehyde ( Mol mas 44 ) 

Hydrogen bonds are a special case of dipole dipole forces , infact ,the strongest dipole dipole force 

## Ion Dipole Forces

---

Forces between an ion and a dipole ( pretty simple huh )

But this is the reason leading to  [Solvation Energy ](Solvation%20Energy%2048c3996f3c0443a0a79bb692498b6033.md) 

This is also the reason behind why its easier to do SN2 in a polar aprotic solvent ( they dont have good dipole , hence they dont form this layer [$SN_1$ v/s $SN_2$](SN_1%20v%20s%20SN_2%204d48c13a75404f07b9626959d2aec8d9.md) 

![Solid%20States%20290b64a75aa2458ebbbbdb584a0077d4/Untitled%202.png](Solid%20States%20290b64a75aa2458ebbbbdb584a0077d4/Untitled%202.png)

In the end these Ion Dipole Forces are Coulumb Forces , so their strength is going to matter on 

- Magnitude of Charge
    - Dipole Strength , more the dipole more partial charge there is
    - More charge on ion ( if instead of Sodium $+1$ there were Calcium $+2$ then there would be even more attraction , more energy would have had to be lost through solvation
- Distance between the charges , I guess this wouldnt matter because there are chuckloads of solvent molecules to solvate a nucleophile or cation or anion

Since Crystalline solids form lattice and amorphous ( apparently ) do not form lattice , the next part of this page will have different types of lattice and which solids have  them and why ? 

# Bravias Lattice

---

Different Types of lattice by varying parameters 

- Cubic
- Tetragonal $(a=b \ne c)$
- Orthorombic $(a \ne b \ne c)$ ( this has all four , S B F E )
- Hexagonal
- Rhombohedral
- Monoclinic
- Triclinic

Different Types of lattice by varying the positions of atoms 

- Simple / Primitive
- Body Centered
- Face Centered
- End Centered

[https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kl9WOYc=/](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kl9WOYc=/)

How the Bravias Lattice Came to be 

Orthorombic is the most flexible yet all angles 90 , because $a \ne b \ne c$ , and it is the only one that  has all S B F E ( Simple , body centered , face centered and end centered ) 

## Rank

---

The Effective number of atoms in a lattice is defined as rank

## Coordination Number

---

The number of nearest surrounding atoms or ions or electrons in a lattice

This doesnt feel like an hcp to me
