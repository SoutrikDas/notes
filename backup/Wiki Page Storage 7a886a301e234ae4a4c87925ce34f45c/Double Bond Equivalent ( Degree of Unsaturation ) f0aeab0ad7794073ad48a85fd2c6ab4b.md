$$DBE=C+1-\frac H2 -\frac X2+\frac N2$$

Oxygens dont cause any degree of unsaturation , hence there is no term for $O$ in the formula 

---

Even if DBE is 2

It means that there can be a ring and double bond , but it doesnt specify that the double bond must be between Carbon 

Ie it can be a ketone double bond 

Although oxygen doesnt contribute to DBE , any double bond between it and Carbon , does actually automatically get counted in DBE

For example Cyclohexanone and Cyclohexene both have DBE=2
