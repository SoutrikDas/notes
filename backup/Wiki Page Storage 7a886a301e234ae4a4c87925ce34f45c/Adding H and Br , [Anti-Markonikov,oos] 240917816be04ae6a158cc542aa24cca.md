This only works well in the case of Br 

Reagent : Peroxides ( $ROOR$ )

Mechanism : Free Radical 

The OË†O bond of the peroxide is easily broken in the presence of light ($hv$) or heat

Notice how RO forms bond with H , making Bromine free radical , 

Why are free radicals like carbocations ? That is , why do they get stabilised by what carbocations are stabilised by ?

Both the ionic and radical pathways are happening together but the radical pathway is much faster ( probably due to more stable TS )
