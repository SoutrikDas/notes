# Learning Github Actions

What is a dockerfile though and how to use it ?

Github actions can use secrets defined in the repository 

So adding and executing an action in github is quite the problematic thing . You need quite a few things to just make one thing work 

Here is a list of things you want 

- `action-a/Dockerfile` - Contains information about the dockerfile

```dart
FROM debian:9.5-slim

ADD entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
```

- `action-a/action.yml` -

```dart
name: "Hello Actions"
description: "Greet someone"
author: "octocat@github.com"

inputs:
  MY_NAME:
    description: "Who to greet"
    required: true
    default: "World"

runs:
  using: "docker"
  image: "Dockerfile"

branding:
  icon: "mic"
  color: "purple"
```

- `action-a/entrypoint.sh` -

```dart
#!/bin/sh -l

sh -c "echo Hello world my name is $INPUT_MY_NAME"
```

- `.github/workflows/main.yml` -

```dart
name: A workflow for my Hello World file
**on: push**
jobs:
  build:
    name: Hello world action
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: ./action-a
        with:
          MY_NAME: "Soutrik"
```

You can modify the `on : push`  to `on: [push , pull_request]` so now it will run on **either** `push` or `pull_request`  so there is a schedule event , which will let you run the action on schedule ( like everyday ) 

```yaml
on: 
	schedule:
		- cron: '*/15 * * * *' # every 15 minutes
```

## Cron Syntax

---

```dart
┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6)
│ │ │ │ │                                   
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

If there is an asterisk , it means `any`

If you have `* * * * *`  it means every minute of every day of ....

`2,19 4,5 * * *1` runs at minute 2 and 10 of the 4th and 5th hour every day

`0 4-6 * * *` runs at every minute 0 of the 4th 5th and 6th hour 

`20/15 * * * *` runs every 15 minutes starting from minute 20 through 59 ( minutes 20 ,35 , and 50 ) 

Use [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/) to check if your cron timings are good 

Some helpful things are 

```dart
// Every Monday at 1PM UTC (9AM EST)
0 13 * * 1

// At the end of every day
0 0 * * *

// Every 10 minutes
*/10 * * * *
```

## Setting up CI for node.js

---

Going through a github tutorial 

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

**on:**
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

**jobs:**
  build:

    **runs-on**: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [10.x, 12.x, 14.x]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm run build --if-present
    - run: npm test
```

The `on:` field is what tells GitHub Actions when to run. In this case, we're running the workflow anytime there's a `push`.

The `jobs:` block defines the core component of an Actions workflow. Workflows are made of `jobs`, and our template workflow defines a single job with the identifier `build`.

Every job also needs a specific host machine on which to run, the `runs-on:` field is how we specify it. The template workflow is running the build job in the latest version of Ubuntu, a Linux-based operating system.

![GitHub%2018976aab08294242b7afb74113cd940e/88589835-f5ce0900-d016-11ea-8c8a-0e7d7907c713.png](GitHub%2018976aab08294242b7afb74113cd940e/88589835-f5ce0900-d016-11ea-8c8a-0e7d7907c713.png)

Let's dig into the vocabulary of GitHub Actions.

- **Workflow**: A workflow is a unit of automation from start to finish, including the definition of what triggers the automation, what environment or other aspects should be taken account during the automation, and what should happen as a result of the trigger.
- **Job**: A job is a section of the workflow, and is made up of one or more steps. In this section of our workflow, the template defines the steps that make up the `build` job.
- **Step**: A step represents one *effect* of the automation. A step could be defined as a GitHub Action, or another unit, like printing something to the console.
- **Action**: A GitHub Action is a piece of automation written in a way that is compatible with workflows. Actions can be written by GitHub, by the open source community, or you can write them yourself!

### `run:`

---

In addition to running pre-built actions, the workflow can also execute commands, just as you would if you had direct access to the virtual machine. In this portion of the template workflow, we run some common commands relevant to Node.js projects, like `npm install` to install dependencies and `npm test` to run the chosen testing framework.

```yaml
steps:
 - uses : <action>
 - uses : <action>
 - run : <commmand as if you were on VM>
```

So I made this simple workflow , 

```yaml
name: A workflow for my Hello World file
on: push
jobs:
  build:
    name: Hello world action
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: ./action-a
        with:
          MY_NAME: "Soutrik"
			- run: pip install numpy
      - run: python ./helloworld.py
```

Where `./helloworld.py` is 

```python
import numpy as np

print("Hello this is pi")
print(np.pi)
```

![GitHub%2018976aab08294242b7afb74113cd940e/Untitled.png](GitHub%2018976aab08294242b7afb74113cd940e/Untitled.png)

and it works , so I can now setup a python script ! ALONG with the dependencies !!

Now I need to figure out how github secrets work 

## Figuring how the secret system works

![GitHub%2018976aab08294242b7afb74113cd940e/Untitled%201.png](GitHub%2018976aab08294242b7afb74113cd940e/Untitled%201.png)

Let me try if I can access these secrets from within the python scripts 

Github changed `myname` to `MYNAME` 

![GitHub%2018976aab08294242b7afb74113cd940e/Untitled%202.png](GitHub%2018976aab08294242b7afb74113cd940e/Untitled%202.png)

If you had a secret named `SECRET_KEY`, you could reference that as `${{secret.SECRET_KEY}}`. or maybe `${{secrets.SECRET_KEY}}` 

But that is only within the yaml file , if you want to use it within the other files then you have to pass the same as an environment variable like described here : 

[Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsenv)

So finally it works and here is the code 

On the workflow side I have used 

```yaml
name: A workflow for my Hello World file
on: push
jobs:
  build:
    name: Hello world action
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: ./action-a
        with:
          MY_NAME: "Soutrik"
      - run: pip install numpy
#       - run: pip install os
      - run: python ./helloworld.py
        **env:
          MYNAME: ${{secrets.MYNAME}}**
```

And on the python side I have used 

```python
import os
print(os.getenv('MYNAME'))
```

### How to run a shell file in a workflow ?

---

I can write shell commands using the `run:`  in the workflow file , but how do I seperate that code ?

just like how you would execute a shell script from the terminal  

```bash
sh ./<path>/scriptname.sh

# or 

chmod +x ./<path>/scriptname.sh
./<path>/scriptname.sh
```

so now I need to know how to write shell scripts such as I can add and commit the downloaded files from github to my repo

For that check this example 

[dwp/manage-mysql-user](https://github.com/dwp/manage-mysql-user/blob/master/.github/workflows/pr.yml#L29)

To even access your repository you have to use 

```bash
actions/checkout@v1
```

> This action checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your workflow can access it.
