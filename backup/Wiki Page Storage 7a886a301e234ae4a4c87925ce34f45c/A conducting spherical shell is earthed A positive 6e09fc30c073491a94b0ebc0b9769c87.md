# A conducting spherical shell is earthed. A positive charge +q_1 is placed at the center and another small positive charge +q_2 is placed at a distance r from q_1. The force on q_2 is ?

Since the Shell can exchange charge with the ground , it can get any amount of charge( + or -) 

But the significance of the grounding is that its potential is always going to be 0 , and that is the most important point. 

> Ignore the effect of induced charge due to $q_2$ on the sphere

So the charge that comes on Sphere is same as $q_1$ but then what ?
