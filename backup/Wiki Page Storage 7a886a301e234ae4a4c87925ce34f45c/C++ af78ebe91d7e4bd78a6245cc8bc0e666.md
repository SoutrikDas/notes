## Running a c++ file in ubuntu

---

```jsx
g++ filename.cpp -o any-name
```

Where `filename.cpp` is the name of the file you wrote , and `any-name` is the name you want the executable file to have after g++ compiles the `.cpp` to `.exe`

So as you can see you cannot open the file normally , instead you have to use this command `./hello`

# Running a c++ file in windows

Download mingw

install g++ one only 

then to compile use 

```css
g++ helloworld.cpp -o helloworld.exe
```

# Dynamically initialise arrays ? ( for size)

---

There are already dynamic arrays out there ! , They are called Vectors !

 So I am stuck of [this problem](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/71/A) 
And I want to take each line into an array.

But problem is , If I do it like this 

```cpp
int n;
	cin>>n;
	char a[50];
	for( int i=1;i<=n;i++){
		
		cin>>a;
		// cout<<a.size();
		cout<<sizeof(a);
	}
	return 0;
```

Then basically the `sizeof(a)` gives me `50` Which is technically the size I defined for `a` , instead I want the size of how much `a` is filled. Now what I can do is to loop over the input and search for the terminating character `\0` or something , and save that as length. 

Or I could use a dynamically allocated array and  then use the `sizeof(a)` on it , to the accurate length.

# Strings ( are dynamic array )

---

New c++  have this new data type 

whose property are

```cpp
name.length() //gives the length 
//you define a string like so
string name;
```

## Substring

---

To get substring use 

```cpp
string s="....";
cout<<s.substr( start,length);
//it will take the substring starting from start , and of the length length
string s="Soutrik"
cout<<s.substr( 2,3); // will give "utr"
```

## Compare strings using built in functions

---

```cpp
s1.compare(s2)
```

Returns an integer that can be positive negative or zero ( zero means they are equal ) 

Generally it does `s1-s2` , ie when you do `"S".compare("T")` you get 

You cannot actually use `"S".compare("T")` , because they are not of `string` data type 

```cpp
cout<<string("S").compare(string("T"));
// output: -1
```

And the reasoning behind the output is that since ASCII of `S` is `83` and `T` is `84` , so $83-84=-1$

But one weird thing happens , 

```cpp
cout<<(int)'S'; //gives 83
cout<<(int)"S"; //gives 4215016
```

So there is a very distinct difference between the `"` and `'` 

## Loop over string like character array

---

```cpp
string s="Soutrik";
cout<<s[1]; //will give you "o"
```

## Finding substrings in strings

---

The function `find(t)` returns the frst index of occurance of `t` 

```cpp
string s="Soutrik";
	cout<<s.find("trik");
	return 0;
// output: 3
```

# Conditional Operator

---

```cpp
Exp1 ? Exp2 : Exp3;
```

### Check the maximum between two numbers

---

```cpp
if ( a>b)c=a;
else if(b>a)c=b;
```

Instead of all that , we can simple use 

```cpp
c=max(a,b);
```
