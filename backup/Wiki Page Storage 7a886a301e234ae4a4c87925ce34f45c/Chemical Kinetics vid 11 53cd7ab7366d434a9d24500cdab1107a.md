On Basis of  Mechanism we have two reactions 

- [Simple , Elementary , SIngle - Step](https://www.notion.so/Elementary-or-Single-Step-Reaction-1b51c9f540e4451982752ea00c75375c)
- Complex , Multi - Step

If Molecularity is more than 3 then its not Elementary. But That **doesnt mean** that All Reactions having less than 3 molecularity are Simple
