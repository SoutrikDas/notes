First of all if the potential of a thin sphere is given then we can use 

$$\frac{kQ_1}{R}=V_0 \\
Q_1=\frac{RV_0}{k}$$

Now we know that the potential of a shell is something like this 

![Copy%20of%20A%20thin%20spherical%20insulating%20shell%20of%20radiu%20140514fc2a624d80921cf4ce4543ca86/Untitled%201.png](Copy%20of%20A%20thin%20spherical%20insulating%20shell%20of%20radiu%20140514fc2a624d80921cf4ce4543ca86/Untitled%201.png)

So the Potential at the Center is also $V_0$ 

Also given in question is an insulating sphere so the charges cant move , hence $\sigma = \cfrac{Q_1}{4\pi R^2}$

Charge $dQ$ of the small hole is $dQ=\alpha Q_1$ now this $dQ$ is removed . So we use negative charge ( like we used in COM ) . With the +ve $dQ$ we complete the Sphere and the -ve parts tays alone 

$$V_{center}=\overbrace{V_0}^{\text{Sphere }}-\overbrace{\frac{k(\alpha Q_1)}{R}}^{\text{due to lone -ve }}$$

Which can also be written as 

$$V_{center}=V_0(1-\alpha)$$

Hence Options A and B are not correct

For option C

EF at both points would be Due to our Small negative Charge 

$$V_A=-\frac{k(\alpha Q_1)}{R}+\frac{k Q_1}{R}\\=\frac{k Q_1(1-\alpha)}{R}$$

$$V_B=-\frac{2k(\alpha Q_1)}{R}+\frac{k Q_1}{R}\\
=+\frac{k Q_1}{R}(1-2\alpha)$$

So the ratio is coming to be $\cfrac{1-\alpha}{1-2\alpha}$

For option D

![Copy%20of%20A%20thin%20spherical%20insulating%20shell%20of%20radiu%20140514fc2a624d80921cf4ce4543ca86/Untitled%203.png](Copy%20of%20A%20thin%20spherical%20insulating%20shell%20of%20radiu%20140514fc2a624d80921cf4ce4543ca86/Untitled%203.png)

$$E_C=\frac{k( Q_1)}{4R^2} \tag{previously}$$

$$E_C=\frac{k( Q_1)}{4R^2} \tag{after}-\frac{k(\alpha Q_1)}{R^2}$$

So the value is reduced by 

$$\frac{\cfrac{k( Q_1)}{4R^2}(1-4\alpha)}{\cfrac{k( Q_1)}{4R^2} }$$

$$1-4\alpha$$

Maybe they are asking about $-\cfrac{k(\alpha Q_1)}{R^2}$ = $-\cfrac{\alpha V_0}{R}$
