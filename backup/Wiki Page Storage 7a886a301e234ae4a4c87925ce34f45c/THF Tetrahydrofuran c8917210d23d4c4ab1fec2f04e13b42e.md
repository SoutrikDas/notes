# Why is it used with [Borane $BH_3$](Borane%20BH_3%20c67e9a17d9e348a4bbff7fa6b8ff8b89.md)  ?

As we know borane has an empty p orbital , so its very electron hungry , THF ( being a electron rich compound ) donates a bit of electron ( which is still not enough to calm down borane , it still looks for other sources of electrons , acting as an Electrophile )
