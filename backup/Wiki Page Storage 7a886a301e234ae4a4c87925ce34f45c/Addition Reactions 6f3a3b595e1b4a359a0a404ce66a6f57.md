# What is an addition Reaction ?

---

An addition reaction is characterized by two groups adding accross a double bond  In the process, the double bond is destroyed, and we say that the two groups (X and Y) have “added” across the double bond.

![Addition%20Reactions%206f3a3b595e1b4a359a0a404ce66a6f57/Untitled.png](Addition%20Reactions%206f3a3b595e1b4a359a0a404ce66a6f57/Untitled.png)

There are many Reactions in this chapter , but we will try to address the following three problems 

1. Predicting the products of a reaction 
2. proposing a mechanism 
3. proposing a synthesis

# Regiochemistry Terminology

---

## When is regiochemistry irrelevant ?

---

- when adding **two of the same group** accross an **symetrical alkene** = Regiochemistry irrelevant
- when adding **two of the same group** accross an **unsymetrical** alkene = Regiochemistry irrelevant
- when adding **two different group** accross an **symetrical** alkene = Regiochemistry irrelevant
- when adding **two different group** accross an **unsymetrical** alkene = **Regiochemistry is Relevant**

In the first three cases , regiochemistry is kind of useless , because either way the product will be same 

![Addition%20Reactions%206f3a3b595e1b4a359a0a404ce66a6f57/Untitled%201.png](Addition%20Reactions%206f3a3b595e1b4a359a0a404ce66a6f57/Untitled%201.png)

This is for the [third case](https://www.notion.so/Addition-Reactions-6f3a3b595e1b4a359a0a404ce66a6f57#58d0ac8d785a4918bf78fe755fae2bfe)

The two very important terminology of regiochemistry are **Markonikov** and **anti-Markonikov**

## Markonikov and anti-Markonikov

---

- Markonikov → When less electronegative ( generally $H$ ) ends up on less substituted carbon
- anti-Markonikov → When less electronegative ends up on more substituted carbon

# Stereochemistry terminology

---

To write down the products correctly we have to understand the stereochemistry along with regiochemistry

Some reactions are not stereospecific, and we might expect all four possible
products (both pairs of enantiomers). Other reactions are stereospecific—we might predominantly get the two enantiomers from a syn addition, or we might predominantly get the two enantiomers from an anti addition. It is important to know which reactions occur through an anti addition, which reactions occur through a syn addition, and which reactions are not stereospecific at all

## Syn and Anti addition

---

![Addition%20Reactions%206f3a3b595e1b4a359a0a404ce66a6f57/Untitled%202.png](Addition%20Reactions%206f3a3b595e1b4a359a0a404ce66a6f57/Untitled%202.png)

All four of them are different . Two of them are syn R and Syn S , and the other are anti R and anti S

If no stereochemistry is mentioned and both places ( where addition is happening ) are stereocenters , then **all four can happen** but if the regiochemistry is also not mentioned ( markonikov or anti-markonokov ) then there will be a total of 8 products 
$\boxed{\overbrace{2}^{\text{markonikov or anti-markonikov}}\times\overbrace{2}^{\text{syn or anti}}\times\overbrace{2}^{\text{R or S}}=8}$

## When is regiochemistry irrelevant ?

---

1. Product has 2 new setereocenters ( relevant )
2. Product has 1 new stereo center  ( irrelevant ) 
3. Product has no stereocenter ( irrelevant )

If the product has 2 stereocenters then the total products will be 4 ( syn R , syn S , anti R, anti S ) question tells us that a reaction is stereospecific ( either syn or anti ) we can narrow down the products from 4 to 2 hence that information has prooved to be useful and hence is relevant

But if the product has 1 sterecenter then the total products will be 2 ( R and S ) , so even if the question tells us the stereochemistry ( either syn or anti ) we wont be able to do anything with it !

> If there is only one stereocenter inside the product then the stereochemistry is still irrelevant. Why? With only one stereocenter, there will only be two possible products (not four). These two products will represent a pair of enantiomers (one will be R and the other will be S). You will get both of these products whether the reaction proceeds through a syn addition or through an anti addition. If the reaction is a syn addition, the OH group can come from above the plane or from below the plane of the molecule, giving both possible products. Similarly, if the reaction is an anti addition, the OH group can come from above the plane or from below the plane of the molecule, giving both possible products. Either way, we get the two possible products.

The bottom line is: the stereochemistry is only relevant when the addition reaction involves the creation of two new stereocenters.
