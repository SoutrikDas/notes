We can do this reaction by first eliminating ( zaitsev , and not Hoffman ) and then markonikov addition 

![Synthesis%20Conversion%20Techniques%207648e51e5d744b8887d5e8ddcc3c1274/Untitled%201.png](Synthesis%20Conversion%20Techniques%207648e51e5d744b8887d5e8ddcc3c1274/Untitled%201.png)

We can control which product we get by carefully choosing our base. If we use a strong base (like methoxide or ethoxide), then we will get the more substituted.However, if we use a strong, sterically hindered base, such as tert-butoxide, then we will get the less substituted alkene.

In the following example we use hoffman 

![Synthesis%20Conversion%20Techniques%207648e51e5d744b8887d5e8ddcc3c1274/Untitled%202.png](Synthesis%20Conversion%20Techniques%207648e51e5d744b8887d5e8ddcc3c1274/Untitled%202.png)

However, we must be careful to control the regiochemistry properly in each of these two steps. In the elimination step, we need to form the less substituted double bond (i.e., the Hoffman product), and therefore, we must use a sterically hindered base.Then, in the addition step, we need to place the Br on the less substituted carbon (anti-Markovnikov addition), so we must use HBr with peroxides. This gives us the following overall synthesis:

![Synthesis%20Conversion%20Techniques%207648e51e5d744b8887d5e8ddcc3c1274/Untitled%204.png](Synthesis%20Conversion%20Techniques%207648e51e5d744b8887d5e8ddcc3c1274/Untitled%204.png)

For the next example 

- But we can also use concentrated acid , to do [Removing OH and H : Acid Catalyzed DeHydration [zaitsev]](Removing%20OH%20and%20H%20Acid%20Catalyzed%20DeHydration%20%5Bzait%20df170e3acf564a559bccd42ed13cdf6c.md) So why dont we do it ?

     We dont do it if later on in the synthesis , we are going to have to use a base 

    For example
