### Install Files in linux from external source ( `abc.tar.gz` )

Use the command 

```jsx
tar xvzf PACKAGENAME.tar.gz
```

Then it will become an executable setup file 

Then just install it 

### How to install `.deb` files ?

---

Deb files are equivalent of `.exe` files in windows , you just need to open them , but with the correct software

### All Commands have the same structure

$$\overbrace{\text{soutrik@soutrik-HP-Laptop-15-da3xxx:  }}^{\text{prompt}}\text{\~ \$} \underbrace{\text{ rm }}_{\text{command}} \overbrace{\text{ -f  }}^{\text{options}}\underbrace{\text{ foo.txt}}_{\text{arguement}}$$

`<username>@<hostname>:<location>$` This is what the prompt consists of , in my case its `soutrik@soutrik-HP-Laptop-15-da3xxx:~$` Lets break this down , So my username is `soutrik` and the hostname is `soutrik-HP-Laptop-15-da3xxx` and the location is `~` ? What does that mean ? Ok , So a tilde `~` means my home directory > the tilde character is shorthand for the user’s home directory!If the shorthand wasn’t there, the prompt at login would be username@ubuntu:/home/username$

## Use `man` to learn more about commands

---

the `man` is itself a command , short for "manual" . You pass in the name of another command as the arguement to man 

![BASH%20Scripting%2062114732f01f42c8961557d51c464b72/man_command_but_small_filesize.gif](BASH%20Scripting%2062114732f01f42c8961557d51c464b72/man_command_but_small_filesize.gif)

# Keyboard Shortcuts

---

## Use `^A` to move to beginning of line and `^E` to move to end in the shell

---

![BASH%20Scripting%2062114732f01f42c8961557d51c464b72/ctrl_a_and_ctrl_e_in_bash.gif](BASH%20Scripting%2062114732f01f42c8961557d51c464b72/ctrl_a_and_ctrl_e_in_bash.gif)

## `^U` Clears the current command that you were writing

---

## `^L` Clears the whole shell

---

# Traversing the maze

How to go somewhere you wamt ? - Use Relative path ( if you are in root , use `cd home` to go to home) - Use Fully qualified path ( wherever you are , use `cd /home` to go to home )

## But how to go `back` one level ?

We could use a fully quantified path but thats too long , instead we use the dot notation `cd ..` takes us one directory towards the root . Also , did I mention that root is the root of everything , everything begins there. Which means that the root `/` is the highest directory , and you cannot do `cd ..` while you are in the root .I mean you can , but it wont give you any results

```
soutrik@soutrik-HP-Laptop-15-da3xxx:/$ cd ..
soutrik@soutrik-HP-Laptop-15-da3xxx:/$ 
```

As you can see , we end up at root .

### What exactly is the root ?

It can mean three things 

1. The lowest point in the filesystem, at `/` 

2. The default superuser, named just `root` 

3. The default superuser’s home directory, at `/root/`

## The rest of the filesystem

```
Location Purpose
/bin/ Contains essential binaries (=tools) used by normal users
/boot/ Contains files used in the boot process: kernel , initramfs , bootloader
/dev/ Contains special files used to access devices
/etc/ Default location for software configuration files
/home/ Contains the home directories for normal users
/lib/ Contains system libraries
/lib64/ Contains 64bit system libraries
/media/ Removable devices such as USB and DVDs can be found here
/mnt/ Empty by default, can be used to mount other filesystems
/opt/ Directory where optional software can be installed
/proc/ Directory where information about processes is stored
/root/ The home directory of the root user
/run/ Contains variable data about run-time data, different each boot
/sbin/ Contains essential sytem binaries (=tools) used by administrative users
/srv/ Directory to place data to be served by the server
/sys/ Contains information about the system, such as drivers and kernel features
Directory intended for temporary files, often cleared on reboot (because it is
/tmp/
stored in RAM, instead of on disk)
/usr/ Contains non-essential files and binaries as read-only user data
/var/ Contains variable files, such as logs
```

## Variables

You can print them using the `echo` command

```
soutrik@soutrik-HP-Laptop-15-da3xxx:/$ echo BASH_VERSION
BASH_VERSION
soutrik@soutrik-HP-Laptop-15-da3xxx:/$ echo $BASH_VERSION
5.0.16(1)-release
```

So to actually access the value of a variable we need to put a `$` sign before it .

# Basic Commands

---

The three most basic commands are 

- `pwd` - Print working directory
- `echo` - prints back to the terminal any text or variable
- `ls` - lists the directory

## The long listing format `ls -l`

This basically prints the data of `ls` in a vertical column like structure (Where each line is either a file or directory) instead of just printing it out in a paragraph next to each other The contents are something like this ( in the root folder )

```
soutrik@soutrik-HP-Laptop-15-da3xxx:/$ ls -l

```

the `d` in the beginning of some of the lines indicate that those are `d`irectories > `d` for directory, `` for regular file, and `l` for symlinks (which are shortcuts under Linux)

You can execute by using this command 

```bash
sudo bash script.sh
```

![BASH%20Scripting%2062114732f01f42c8961557d51c464b72/execute_properly.gif](BASH%20Scripting%2062114732f01f42c8961557d51c464b72/execute_properly.gif)

# What does a script contain ?

## # Comments

---

Comments are written like this 

```bash
# this is a comment 
echo helloworld # this is also a comment
```

A command may not follow a comment on the same line.

 

```bash
echo "The # here does not begin a comment."
echo 'The # here does not begin a comment.'
echo The \# here does not begin a comment.
echo The # here begins a comment.
```

## #! Sha-bang

---

Lines starting with `#!` are not comments , but they are useful stuff that the machine reads to understand which shell to use.

These are ( I think ) like the pre processor directives in [C++](C++%20af78ebe91d7e4bd78a6245cc8bc0e666.md) 

## Two or more commands in the same line ?

---

```bash
echo "hello" ; echo "world"
```

![BASH%20Scripting%2062114732f01f42c8961557d51c464b72/two_commands_in_one_line.gif](BASH%20Scripting%2062114732f01f42c8961557d51c464b72/two_commands_in_one_line.gif)

# Permissions

---

## User Group

---

Check which groups you are in with the command `id`

```bash
soutrik@soutrik-HP-Laptop-15-da3xxx:~/coding_projects$ id
uid=1000(soutrik) gid=1000(soutrik) groups=1000(soutrik),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),120(lpadmin),131(lxd),132(sambashare)
```

![BASH%20Scripting%2062114732f01f42c8961557d51c464b72/id.gif](BASH%20Scripting%2062114732f01f42c8961557d51c464b72/id.gif)

This means that the current user has a `uid` ( User ID) of `1000` and a primary `gid` ( Yes users can have a lot of groups , so there can be a lot of `gid` ), so the primary `gid` is also `1000` 

## RWX Permissions

---

In essence, every file (or directory, which is just a different type of file), has the
following attributes:

- The file is owned by a user, which has (part of) the RWX permissions
- The file is also owned by a group, which again, has (part of) the RWX permissions
- The file finally has RWX permissions for others, which means all different users
that don't share the group

So a file doesnt simply have `rwx` but it has multiple `rwxrwx--x` like permission

Where the `-` says that the permission is missing.

Meaning that if the original permission should have been `rwx` and instead its like `r-x` then that means that the group or person cannot write , but can read and execute.

Now the problem is , in what order are  they in ?

A typical `ls -l` gives something like this 

```bash
drwxrwxr-x 3 soutrik soutrik 4096 Oct  7 17:57 'Data Projects'
```

Lets break the above code into two parts and analyze them

```bash
**drwxrwxr-x** **3 soutrik soutrik 4096 Oct  7 17:57 'Data Projects'**
```

$$\color{pink}\overbrace{\text{d}}^{\text{its a directory}} \underbrace{\text{rwx}}_{\text{user soutrik}}\overbrace{\text{rwx}}^{\text{group soutrik}} \underbrace{\text{r-x}}_{\text{others not in group}}

$$

$$\color{cyan}\text{ 3 }\phantom{aa} \overbrace{\text{soutrik}}^{\text{User soutrik owns it}} \phantom{aa}\overbrace{\text{soutrik}}^{\text{Group soutrik owns it}} \phantom{aa} \text{4096 Oct  7 17:57 'Data Projects'}$$

## Modifying permissions and ownerships

---

We use `chmod` ( read as **Ch**ange File**mod**e) 

It has two operating modes 

- Symbolic mode
- numeric/octal mode

Using man we find some information

[]()

The way to use `chmod` command is 

$$\text{chmod }  $$
