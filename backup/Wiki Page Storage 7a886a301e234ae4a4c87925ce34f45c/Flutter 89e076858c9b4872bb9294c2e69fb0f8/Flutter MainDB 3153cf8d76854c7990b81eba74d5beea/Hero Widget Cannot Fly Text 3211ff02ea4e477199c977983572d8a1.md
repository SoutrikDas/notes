# Hero Widget Cannot Fly Text

Tags: bug

This is a long standing bug 

[Text in Hero red when animating 路 Issue #30647 路 flutter/flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/30647#issuecomment-480980280)

[Widgets inserted to an Overlay have different ancestral InheritedWidget(s) than commonly expected 路 Issue #36220 路 flutter/flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/36220)

Wrapping it in Material Totally Obliterates the problem !!!
