The following is a Single Step Reaction :

## That Reaction For which Experimental Rate **follows** Law of Mass Action is an elementary Reaction.

$$A+B \to C$$

Then iff The rate Law **comes out** (experimentally) the following :

$$Rate =k[A]^1[B]^1 \tag{from experiment}$$

Then and only then will it be an Elementary Reaction 

These Reactions DO NOT Have an Intermediate 

## Single Step Reactions CANNOT have an intermediate

Why ? Because having an intermediate in itself means that the reaction is more than one step.

This is a two step Reaction , With one [Intermediate](https://www.notion.so/Intermediate-v-s-Transition-State-1393c38934a44043b5d38e701918b3e0) , The valley in between  is the intermediate.

# Molecularity of a Single Step Reaction Cannot exceed 3

But that also doesnt mean that all reactions under 3 molecularity are Simple
