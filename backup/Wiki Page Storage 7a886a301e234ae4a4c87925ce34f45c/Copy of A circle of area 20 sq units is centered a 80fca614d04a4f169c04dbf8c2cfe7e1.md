# Copy of A circle of area 20 sq. units is centered at point O , suppose \triangleABC is inscribed in that circle and has area 8 sq. units. The central angles are \alpha, \beta, and  \gamma are as shown in the figure . The value of (\sin \alpha + \sin \beta + \sin \gamma) is equal to ?

Are of the triangle can be found using cross product 

$$\overbrace{\frac{R^2 \sin  \alpha}{2}  + \frac{R^2 \sin  \beta}{2} +\frac{R^2 \sin  \gamma}{2}}
^{\text{from cross product}}
=\overbrace8 ^{\text{given}} \tag1$$

And from the area of the circle we can get 

$$\pi R^2=20 \\
\tag2R^2=\frac{20}{\pi}$$

Using (2) in (1) we get 

$$\sin \alpha + \sin \beta + \sin \gamma= 
\frac{4\pi}{5} $$
