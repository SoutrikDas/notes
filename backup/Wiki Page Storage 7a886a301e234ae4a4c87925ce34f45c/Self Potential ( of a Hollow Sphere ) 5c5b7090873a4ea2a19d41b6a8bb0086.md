The use of SPE is **not** to find potential at any point , rather it is used to find the total potential energy of a system ( using Self Potential Energy and Interactional Potential Energy )

# How to derive

So we will assume that we are bringing small charges from infinity to form the hollow sphere

but there can be two ways of depositing the small charges ( this is where I was very confused ) 

We are not doing this :

In this gif ( which is the wrong way ) the charge is like a stone getting stuck on a muddy sphere

We are doing this:

Think of each $dq$ charge as a drop of water that wraps around the sphere with a very very thin layer of charge 

Now suppose we already have a layer of $q$ charge and a $dq$ charge is being brought to the sphere from infinity , then the work done ( which is the potential energy ) for this $dq$ is 

$$W_{ext}=dq(V_f-V_i)$$

But we are bringing the charge from infinity and we assume $V_\infin=0$ 

$$W_{ext}=dq(V_f)$$

$$dW_{ext}=dq(\frac{kq}{R})$$

$$\int_0^SdW_{ext}=\int_0^Qdq(\frac{kq}{R})$$

$$S=\frac 12\frac{kq^2}{R}$$

Where $S$ is the potential energy
