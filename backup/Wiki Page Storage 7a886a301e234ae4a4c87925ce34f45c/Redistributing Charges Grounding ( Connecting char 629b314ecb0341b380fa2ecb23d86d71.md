> The points that are connected will finally have the same potential ( note : The bodies as a whole may or may not have same potential , but the points will have )

For example 

Then $V_A=V_B$

So we can imagine there being some charge transfer after which the charges on left sphere is $q_1$ and the charge on right sphere is $q_2$ , and we know that charges were conserved , ie 

$q_1+q_2=10Q_o$ 

Now we can write the formula for potential at A and B 

$$\frac{kq_1}{2R_o} =\frac{kq_2}{R_o}$$

From this we learn that $q_1=2q_2$ 

Therefore 

$$q_1= \frac{2}{3} 10 Q_o$$

$$q_2= \frac{1}{3} 10 Q_o$$

 We could have done this in another way 

We know the capacitance for an isolated conductor right ?

So from this the capacitance of a sphere is 

First find the potential at surface ( why at surface ? I dk ) 

$$V=\frac{kQ}{R}$$

$$C=\frac  QV=\frac R k=4\pi \varepsilon R$$

Let the initial charges on the two spheres be $Q_1$ , $Q_2$ , and the final charges be $q_1$ and $q_2$ 

Now when we connect the two spheres the potentials are equated 

$$V_1=V_2$$

$$\frac {q_1}{C_1}=\frac{q_2}{C_2}$$

So for this question we are given 

- $Q_1=3Q_0$
- $R_1=2R_0$ so $C_1=2C_0$
- $Q_2=7Q_0$
- $R_2=R_0$ and $C_2=C_0$

so 

$$q_1=2q_2$$

and we know the sum is $10Q_0$ 

so we understand that 
$q_1=2/3 \times 10 Q_0$

$q_2=1/3 \times 10Q_0$
