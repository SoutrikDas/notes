What is contact angle even ?  For that information , go [here](Fluid%20Statics%20(%20Hydrostatics%20)%2081f1af117a754b2c990c63bc2ee42d1b.md)

    the rules for determining the contact angle are ( Point of contact → For liquid Away from Solid  → For Solid Toward Liquid )

What is the excess pressure inside a water bubble / Convex side ? 

- For a short rundown of Excess pressure and derivation , open this

    $$P_L-P_E=\frac{2S}{R}$$

    $$P_{\text{inside}}-P_{\text{outside}}=\frac{2S}{R}$$

    $$P_{\text{concave}}-P_{\text{convex}}=\frac{2S}{R}$$

    But why is this the formula ? For the short derivation go [here](https://youtu.be/Us7sk1OrcUc?t=852)

Now having a contact angle of $0\degree$ means the liquid has wetted the solid very much , almost impossibly so 

![A%20cylindrical%20capillary%20tube%20of%200%202%20mm%20radius%20is%20m%202b54ce7ef00a455592040d1fec07c0a7/Untitled%202.png](A%20cylindrical%20capillary%20tube%20of%200%202%20mm%20radius%20is%20m%202b54ce7ef00a455592040d1fec07c0a7/Untitled%202.png)

But anyway thats not the point , the point is to figure out how the height will change when there are two different materials 

Using the Formula 

$$h=\frac{2S\cos \theta}{\rho g R}$$

We find that the two heights are

$$h_1=\frac{2S\cos 0 \degree}{\rho g R}=\frac{2S}{\rho g R}$$

$$h_2=\frac{2S\cos 60 \degree}{\rho g R}=\frac{S}{\rho gR}$$

But halt , what if , this happens ?

![A%20cylindrical%20capillary%20tube%20of%200%202%20mm%20radius%20is%20m%202b54ce7ef00a455592040d1fec07c0a7/Untitled%203.png](A%20cylindrical%20capillary%20tube%20of%200%202%20mm%20radius%20is%20m%202b54ce7ef00a455592040d1fec07c0a7/Untitled%203.png)

Indeed , Lets calculate the values first 

- $h_1$ is when the final meniscus is formed in 1 ( $0\degree$ )
- $h_2$ is when the final meniscus is formed in T2

What are the values given ? ( in SI units ) 

- $S=0.075$
- $\rho=1000$
- $g=10$
- $R=2\times 10^{-4}$

$$h_1=\frac{2S\cos 0 \degree}{\rho g R}=\frac{2S}{\rho g R}$$

$$h_1=\frac{2\times 0.075}{10^4\times 2\times 10^{-4}}$$

$$h_1=0.075 m $$

Which means 7.5 cm 

But this scenaria can happen in two ways 

![A%20cylindrical%20capillary%20tube%20of%200%202%20mm%20radius%20is%20m%202b54ce7ef00a455592040d1fec07c0a7/Untitled%204.png](A%20cylindrical%20capillary%20tube%20of%200%202%20mm%20radius%20is%20m%202b54ce7ef00a455592040d1fec07c0a7/Untitled%204.png)

In both cases the meniscus is formed at T1

If the meniscus were formed in T2 

then 

$$h_2=0.0375m$$

$$h_2=3.75 cm$$

So case A , B , C checks out . 

But Case D is a bit difficult , because , if the joint is at $5cm$ then if the meniscus forms at T1 , the height will be $7.5cm$ which is a contradiction because then it wont be in T1 , but in T2 .

But again , if we assume that we are in T2 , then the height is going to be $3.75cm$ but that is a contradiction , since that will be in T1 . 

So where exactly will the meniscus be ? I dont know , but we should try the joint , maybe something happens there ?

We should see the process frame by frame 

- T1=Green
- T2=Black

But my point is , when the meniscus is transforming , it may encounter such a contact angle $\phi$ that it doesnt need to change any more !

![A%20cylindrical%20capillary%20tube%20of%200%202%20mm%20radius%20is%20m%202b54ce7ef00a455592040d1fec07c0a7/meniscuschangeshape.gif](A%20cylindrical%20capillary%20tube%20of%200%202%20mm%20radius%20is%20m%202b54ce7ef00a455592040d1fec07c0a7/meniscuschangeshape.gif)

This is we thought would happen 

![A%20cylindrical%20capillary%20tube%20of%200%202%20mm%20radius%20is%20m%202b54ce7ef00a455592040d1fec07c0a7/actualmeniscuschangeshape.gif](A%20cylindrical%20capillary%20tube%20of%200%202%20mm%20radius%20is%20m%202b54ce7ef00a455592040d1fec07c0a7/actualmeniscuschangeshape.gif)

THis is what actually happens

Using that idea , we can assume that angle to be $\phi$ 

and then 

![A%20cylindrical%20capillary%20tube%20of%200%202%20mm%20radius%20is%20m%202b54ce7ef00a455592040d1fec07c0a7/Untitled%205.png](A%20cylindrical%20capillary%20tube%20of%200%202%20mm%20radius%20is%20m%202b54ce7ef00a455592040d1fec07c0a7/Untitled%205.png)

Equating the pressure at the bottom 

$$P_o=P_o-\overbrace{\frac{2S\cos \phi}{R}}^{\text{due to meniscus}}+\rho g(5cm)$$

From this we get that 

$$\cos \phi =\frac 23$$

and since we know that 

$$\cos ^{-1} \frac 2 3 >\frac 12$$

We can say that 

$$\phi<60 \degree$$

Which means , it does indeed get stopped before transforming into a meniscus of contact angle $60\degree$
