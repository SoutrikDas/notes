If $f(x)$ is continuous on $[a, \infty]$ then $\int_{a}^{\infty} f(x) d x$ is called an improper integral and is defined as

$$
\int_{a}^{\infty} f(x) d x=\lim_{b \rightarrow \infty} \int{a}^{b} f(x) d x
$$

If there exists a finite limit on the right hand side of Eq. (i), then we can say that the improper integral is convergent; otherwise it is divergent.
