# An automobile has a weight of 2700 lb and is traveling forward at 4 ft/s when it crashes into the wall. If the impact occurs in 0.06 s, determine the average impulsive force acting on the car. Assume the brakes are not applied. If the coefficient of kinetic friction between the wheels and the pavement is Î¼k = 0.3, calculate the impulsive force on the wall if the brakes were applied during the crash. The brakes are applied to all four wheels so that all the wheels slip

What are we given ?

- $m=2700lb$
- $v=4ft/s$
- $\Delta t=0.04$

Net momentum change from Moving state to stopped state just after the crash , is 

$$I=P_f-P_i$$

$$I=0-mv$$

From this we can find the average impulse 

and from the fact that 

$$F\Delta t=I$$

We can find the Force . ( which in this case is just the impulsive force from the crash ) 

Now if the brakes were applied , that value of $F$ will also account for the force of friction ( but is friction impulsive ?)

$$(F_{wall}+F_{friction})\Delta t=I$$

How do we find out the friction force ? For each tire , the friction force is $\mu_k mg$ 

for four tires , it will be 

$$F_{friction}=4\mu_k mg$$

$$(F_{wall}+4\mu_k mg)\Delta t=I$$

Since we know $\Delta t$ and $I$ ( we know $I=0-mv$ ) we can find $F_{wall}$
