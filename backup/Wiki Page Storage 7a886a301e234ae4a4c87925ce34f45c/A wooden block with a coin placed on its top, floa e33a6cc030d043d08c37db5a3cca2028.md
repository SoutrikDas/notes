I guess there is no way other than to rigourously do this 

- $\rho_1$ is the density of coin
- $\rho _2$ is the density of block
- $\rho$ is the density of water
- $V_1$ is the volume of the coin
- $V_2$ is the volume of the block
- $A$ is the area of the base of the beaker or pool or whatever

For the first part When the coin drops ( or as it is dropping but not yet into the water ) how much does the water level rise up ? It actually comes down 

by the amount that the coin was displacing due to its weight 

so 

$$V_1\rho_1g=V\rho g$$

$$V=\frac{V_1\rho_1}{\rho}$$

So the actual decrease in height will be 

$$\Delta h_1=-\frac {V_1\rho_1}{A\rho}$$

Now for the second part , the coin falls into the pool , this time displacing the water equal to its own volume 

$$V_w=V_1$$

So this time the water goes up by 

$$\Delta h_2=+\frac {V_1}{A}$$

So the net change 

$$\Delta h_{net}=\frac{V_1}{A}-\frac {V_1\rho_1}{A\rho}$$

Which means that the net change is zero only if the densities are same 

For this particular case , metal being heavier than water , the water level will go down
