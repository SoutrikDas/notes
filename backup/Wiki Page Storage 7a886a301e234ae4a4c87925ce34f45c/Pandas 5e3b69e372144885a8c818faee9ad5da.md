My goal today is to process the data sets of 1st 2nd 3rd ..7th , for my admission into an iit 

So what exactly is my goal ? to process these files and use filter . Thats all ? Then I should use excel ?

No , the idea is to show the progression of different files , sorts , etc. Or maybe the idea is to just explore pandas

[Pandas functions and attributes](Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/Pandas%20functions%20and%20attributes%20694fa51d7d5143c3b33ef1360e497f3b.csv)

# Make a Dataframe

---

## Dataframe from csv

---

```python
df=pd.read_csv('path')
# if the path contains \ then use the below raw string
df=pd.read_csv( r'...')
```

# Access

---

## Access one column of df

---

```python
df["email"]
# OR
df.email
# but the latter only works when there is one word
```

But this is of the type `Series`

![Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/series.gif](Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/series.gif)

### What is a Series ?

---

A series is rows of a single column 

So a dataframe is a container for multiple of series objects 

## Access two or more columns of df

---

We were accessing one column using

```python
df["email"]
```

We will access two or more columns using 

```python
df[ ["email","name"] ]
# the basic syntax is df [   list  ]
```

But now  , this is not a Series . It now returns another dataframe 

![Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/multiple_returns_a_df.gif](Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/multiple_returns_a_df.gif)

## Get all the column names

---

Since accesing dframes require names 

```python
df["email"]
```

So you need to know the column name right ( in this case "email" ) 

But you cannot mug up the column names 

The easy way is to use `df.columns` 

![Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/not_exactly_a_list.gif](Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/not_exactly_a_list.gif)

Although it doesnt return a pure list , it returns something that can be used like a list 

## Using `iloc`

---

### Access a single row Using `df.iloc`

---

the `i` in `iloc` stands for integer location , it uses these ( marked in red ) integers to locate 

![Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/iloc_integers.gif](Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/iloc_integers.gif)

![Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/iloc.gif](Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/iloc.gif)

as you can see , the return type is a series 

### Access a single rows single column using `iloc`

---

Since in iloc everything has to be integer , you cannot use column name to denote a colum , rather there is a index, that is 0 → name , 1 → email , ...etc . All columns are assigned this index numbers starting from 0 , just like how all rows are assigned an index number . The difference is that for rows , these index are shown , for columns they are not 

the syntax for single row's single column is a bit like this 

$$\text{df.iloc[ Row , Column ]}$$

![Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/single_row_single_column.gif](Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/single_row_single_column.gif)

### Accessing multiple rows using `iloc`

---

just like how we accesed more than one columns , similarly we can access more than one rows 

![Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/iloc_for_multiple_rows.gif](Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/iloc_for_multiple_rows.gif)

### Accessing multiple rows single column using `iloc`

---

![Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/multiple_row_single_column.gif](Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/multiple_row_single_column.gif)

### Accessing multiple rows and multiple columns using `iloc`

---

the transition from single column to multiple columns is very similar to rows 

```css
df.iloc[ 0 ] # for one row
df.iloc [ list ] # for many rows 
```

Similarly 

```css
df.iloc[ list , 0 ] # for many row one column
df.iloc[ list , list2 ] # for many row many column
```

![Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/multiple_row_multiple_column_iloc.gif](Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/multiple_row_multiple_column_iloc.gif)

## Using `loc`

---

So what is different between `iloc` and `loc` ? , In `loc` you will use labels instead of integers 

Okay I do understand that there are labels for columns like `df.loc["email"]` but what about labels for rows ? For that , we will use the indexes . Those will become our labels 

### Accessing rows using default index using `loc`

---

This will be very similar to `iloc` since both use integers , `iloc` specifically uses integers , but `loc` uses labels , but since we dont have any labels for the rows , its default "labels" for rows is the integer indexings

![Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/iloc_integers.gif](Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/iloc_integers.gif)

so `df.loc[0]` and `df.iloc[0]` will give the same output 

![Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/loc_and_iloc_same_when_default.gif](Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/loc_and_iloc_same_when_default.gif)

### Columns using `loc`

---

So when we write 

```css
df.loc[ [0,1,2] ]
```

We get the rows `0` `1` and `2` with all of their columns 

But what we can do now , is to use the labels to select specific columns 

```css
df.loc[ [0,1,2] , ["Hobbyist","Age"] ]
```

![Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/loc_multiple_columns.gif](Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/loc_multiple_columns.gif)

## Access using Slicing and `loc`

---

Using the `df.loc[ [0,1,2] , "Hobbyist" ]` we get something like this 

![Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/rough.gif](Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/rough.gif)

But what if we want a lot of rows ? maybe a 100, are we going to do 

```css
df.loc[[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11....] , "Hobbyist" ]
```

The answer is No , we are going to take a slice 

![Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/slice_.gif](Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/slice_.gif)

As you can see , when you take a slice , remove the `[]` , and also notice how the last value of the slice was included ( ie 100 was included even if your slice was `0:100` ) This is the case with `loc` and some other functions , but not all functions 

Now what about a slice in the columns ? For this ( atleast in `loc` ) we need to know the two column names 

![Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/slicing_in_the_column.gif](Pandas%205e3b69e372144885a8c818faee9ad5da/slicing_in_the_column.gif)

# Set , Reset , Custom Indexes

---

So the default indexes go something like this 

```css
0    Row1
1    Row2
...  ...
n    Row(n+1)
```

But we can set our own custom index !
