# A hemispherical portion of Radius R is removed from the bottom of a cylinder of Radius R . The Volume of the remaining cylinder is V and its mass is M . It is suspended by a string in a liquid of density \rho where it stays vertical . The upper surface of the cylinder is h hight below surface. What is the force on the bottom by the liquid ?

The sum of the forces acting on the up and down come together to form the buyoant force

Which means 

$$F_{bottom}-F_{uppersurface}=V\rho g$$

$$F_{bottom}=\overbrace{(P_o+\rho gh)(\pi R^2)}^{\text{Force on upper surface}}+V\rho g$$

$$F_{bottom}=P_o\pi R^2+\rho gh\pi R^2+V\rho g$$

Why did we find it this way ? because the bottom surface is not regular , there is no constant pressure acting on it , rather different magnitudes of pressure are acting , so how do you find the pressure from there ? 

In the case of Excess pressure in a liquid bubble , the outer pressure was absolutely the same , but here it is not , 

Also , we do not know the pressure at that depth 

The fourth option matches if and only if $P_o=0$ , and indeed the answer D is correct in the book
