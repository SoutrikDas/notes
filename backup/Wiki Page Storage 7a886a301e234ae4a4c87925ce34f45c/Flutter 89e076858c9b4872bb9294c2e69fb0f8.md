Everything in flutter is a widget 

At the very root , is `Root Widget` 

So the directory of a very simple app is like this 

![Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/Untitled.png](Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/Untitled.png)

Where all the code and assets should be placed in `lib` folder 

Right now we only have one `dart` file 

![Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/Untitled%201.png](Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/Untitled%201.png)

And  the code inside of it is 

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        
        visualDensity: VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  MyHomePage({Key key, this.title}) : super(key: key);

 

  final String title;

  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  int _counter = 0;

  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
     
      _counter++;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        
        title: Text(widget.title),
      ),
      body: Center(
        
        child: Column(
          
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'You have pushed the button this many times:',
            ),
            Text(
              '$_counter',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _incrementCounter,
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Basically what is happening is that there is `main` function thats supposed to run 

and we are putting the statement 

```dart
runApp(MyApp());
```

Where `MyApp` is a Class that extends from stateless widget ( meaning `MyApp` is a stateless widget ) 

Then we are overriding the build function ( this is used to build the widget but the specifics of it is unknown 

Setting the Background color of `appBar` to something ,we can use the following statements

```dart
backgroundColor: Color**s**.red[500],
```

Remember , its `Colors.` not `Color.` Thats a problem I had . 

# Problems Related to Flutter

[Flutter MainDB](Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/Flutter%20MainDB%203153cf8d76854c7990b81eba74d5beea.csv)

# Stateful v/s Stateless Widgets

---

In flutter there can be two types of widgets 

- Stateless widget - the state of the widget **cannot** change over time
- Stateful Widget - the state of the widget **can** change over time

Stateful widgets contain dynamic data , or data that can change 

## Stateless Widgets and Inability to Hot Reload

---

Right now the code is 

```dart
void main()
{
runApp(MaterialApp(...));
}
```

So every time we have to hot restart to actually build the app from start 

But if we make a new widget out of it like so

```dart
void main()
{ runApp(MyWidget());
}

Class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget
{
	@override
	Widget build()
	{
		return ... ;
	}
}
```

So now the code looks like this 

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main()
{
  runApp(MaterialApp(
	**home: MyWidget(),**
	));
}
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("This is an appbar"),
        backgroundColor: Colors.red[500],
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          "Maybe someday you will read this ",
          style: TextStyle(
            fontSize: 20,
            fontWeight:FontWeight.bold,
            fontFamily: 'zcool',
          ),
        ),

      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(

      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Note you are not `runApp(MyWidget())` but `runApp(MaterialApp(...))` and setting the home page to `MyWidget()`

## How to get Documentation

---

Press `Ctrl+Q` for documentation

![Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/how_to_get_documentation.gif](Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/how_to_get_documentation.gif)

And the documentation would be something like this 

![Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/Untitled%202.png](Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/Untitled%202.png)

## How to indent multiple lines

---

You can do two things 

### Let Android studio decide everything

---

Select stuff and press `Ctrl+Alt+L` This will refactor or something 

### Select all and press `Tab` or `Shift+Tab`

---

This is pretty self explanatory

# Buttons

## Floating action button

---

So the scaffold widget has a prebuilt place for floating action button 

```dart
appBar: ...
body: ....
floatingActionButton : ...
```

And We pass in the Widget

```dart
floatingActionButton : FloatingActionButton()
```

It has three useful property 

- `child:`
- `backgroundColor:`
- `onPressed:`

Where we pass a function in onPressed  , a Color in backgroundColor and Text or emoji or something in the child ( the text then appears inside the button ) 

## RaisedButton

---

three things are very necessary 

- `onPressed`
- `child` Maybe add some text and icons ?

This kind of a button has a bit of shadow 

## RaisedButton.icon

---

This is a seperate constructor , we can make different constructors with adding a name to them `<class name>.<constructor special name>` 

So this constructor creates a `Raised Button` with a icon and some text ( or maybe something else ) 

This is how we use it 

This does not have a `child` variable , rather it has `label` and an `icon` seperately 

![Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/RaisedButton_dot_icon.gif](Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/RaisedButton_dot_icon.gif)

![Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/WhatsApp_Image_2020-10-16_at_7.00.03_PM.jpeg](Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/WhatsApp_Image_2020-10-16_at_7.00.03_PM.jpeg)

This is how it looks

## IconButton

---

Basically a small Icon , that can be pressed  , But it doesnt really look pressable at all 

## How to use the `onPressed()`

---

So you can pass a anonymous function like this 

![Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/anonymous_function.gif](Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/anonymous_function.gif)

Or you can use a named function like this 

![Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/how_to_use_a_named_function.gif](Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/how_to_use_a_named_function.gif)

# Text

---

The text widget is very simple at the start , just taking in the string 

```dart
Text("Hello World")
```

But to make it more complicated we can also pass some properties  , like a style 

```dart
Text(
"Hello WOrld" , 
style : TextStyle(),
}
```

Note , unlike most widgets that have the `child:` property to store the main text or image , The `Text` widget doesnt take a property , rather the first arguement is just the string , the second arguement is however there is a property 

# Fonts

How to include a third party font ? ( maybe you downloaded it from somewhere or google fonts)

How do You include that ?

Lets at least download the font first 

![Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/download_a_font.gif](Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/download_a_font.gif)

Download 

![Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/extract_it_somewhere.gif](Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/extract_it_somewhere.gif)

Extract to get `.ttf`

![Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/put_the_font_in_a_folder_inside_project_directory.gif](Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/put_the_font_in_a_folder_inside_project_directory.gif)

Move to somewhere inside project directory

Now we have to tell flutter that we have a font we can use , by modifying the `pubspec.yaml` 

 

![Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/edit_pubspec_yaml.gif](Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/edit_pubspec_yaml.gif)

In the above gif , I made a mistake by not indenting it . The `font` should be under `flutter` hence it should be indented with two spaces. Another error I made was to use `assets` . The actual word is `asset`

![Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/use_asset_and_indent.gif](Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/use_asset_and_indent.gif)

the name of the font is now `zcool` 

so you name the fonts by 

```dart
fonts:
	- family: <font name>
		fonts:
			- assets : <path to ttf>< file name>.ttf
```

So even though the file has some different name , like `ZCOOL_QingKe_HuangYou.ttf` , we will address  it with the name we set , in this case thats `zcool`

Now how to use this font ?Put the following code inside the `TextStyle()`

```dart
fontFamily: <font name that you defined>
```

# Images

---

There are two types of image

- Network Image : Get an image from an url and display it
- Asset Image : Get an image from the source and display it

A network image is a bit easier to add , because for a offline image you have to declare it as an asset in the `pubspec.yaml` file 

![Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/add_a_Network_Image.gif](Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/add_a_Network_Image.gif)

Another way to insert Image is to 

```dart
child: Image.network("url")
```

Here is how to add an Asset Image 

![https://i.ibb.co/VpCGcdW/add-an-asset-image.gif](https://i.ibb.co/VpCGcdW/add-an-asset-image.gif)

You can either declare all the images like so 

```dart
assets : 
	- assets/image01.png
	- assets/image02.png
  - ...

```

Or you can simply declare the asset  folder as an asset, and by doing so , you will declare all the childs of that folder as assets

```dart
assets : 
	- assets/
```

You can also add an Asset Image like so 

```dart
child: Image.asset( "relative path "),
```

# Icon

---

To use a Icon just use this code 

```dart
body: Center( 
	child: Icon(
		Icons.airport_shuttle,
		)
	)
```

You can also specify color , size etc etc

# Containers Margin and Padding

---

Padding is inside , Margin is outside 

So how do you even add those ?

```dart
padding : EdgeInserts.all(20.0),
```

# Rows and Column

---

```dart
~~body: Row(
	child: ...
)~~
body: Row(
	children : <Widget>[ ... ],
)
```

where the `children` takes in a list of widgets ( strictly ) 

## Set the axis alignment using mainAxisAlignment and crossAxisAlginment

---

For Column the main axis is $y$ axis and its cross axis is $x$ axis 

For Row the main axis is $x$ axis and its cross axis is $y$ axis  

# Routes and Map

---

To make routes we use the route property of Material app 

```dart
void main() => runApp( MaterialApp(
	home: Home(),
	route: //put a Map here 
));
```

So a few things to keep in mind is that  `/` is the root , or the first page to open , 

But for the moment , we can overwrite it using the `~~home` property~~  `initRoute:` propoerty 

So the question is , We have a widget , and we want to load it up , using routes , how do we do it ?

```dart
// first get the name of the widget 
void main() => runApp( MaterialApp(
	home: Home(),
	route: {
	...
	"< the route name >": <function to evoke our widget>,
	...
	}
));
```

So two things , the `<the route name>`  , what is this ?

This is like in websites they have a examplesite.com**/location**

Its something like that , a custom name , a keyword that you want to adress your widget from the next time.

The `<function to evoke our widget>` is a function that will evoke our widget ?

It should be something like this 

$$\text{(context) => Home() }$$

This is basically an anonymous function , if we write it out it would be like this 

```dart
"/location" : (context) => LocationWidget(),

// oR 

"/location" : (context) { return LocationWidget(); },
```

Its just an arrow function

[https://discord.com/channels/420324994703163402/421445316617961502/767232851477004298](https://discord.com/channels/420324994703163402/421445316617961502/767232851477004298)  

## How to pass In arguements when routing ?

---

Suppose you have a widget that takes in some input and makes a page accordingly , and normally you use this 

```dart
Navigator.of(context).pushNamed("Info")
```

to route , what are you going to do 

Actually I would rather use 

```dart
Navigator.pushNamed( context , "Info" , <arguements> );
```

As you can see the documentation ( `Ctrl +Q` ) It has a place for arguements 

![Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/Untitled%203.png](Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/Untitled%203.png)

![Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/passing_in_inputs.gif](Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/passing_in_inputs.gif)

So How do we get back the inputs in the other widget ? 

Using the 

```dart
widget.map = ModalRoute.of(context).settings.arguments;
widget.text = widget.map["text"];
```

In the other widget 

# Async Await Future

---

A future is like a closed box , that when opened can have a value or an error 

So a Future can be in three states 

- Uncompleted
- Completed with a value
- completed with an Error

its used something like this 

```dart
Future.delayed( Duration(seconds:3) , func1 ).then( func2 ).catchError( func3 );
```

We can put anonymous functions instead of func1 , func2 and func 3  like so 

```dart
Future<int>.delayed( Duration(seconds:3) , () =>12)
	.then( (value) { print(value+1); }
		.catchError( (err) {print("Caught some error $err");}  ;
```

Remember , the `then` takes a function which takes a `value` in , and  `catchError` takes a function that takes an `error` in , ( but I guess , thats also a value right ?)

# Interact with API's

---

To send a request  , first include the `http` module 

Now the `get(...)` function returns a object of type `Response` , so 

![Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/Repsonse.gif](Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/Repsonse.gif)

But this response object is not something useful

If you print it , you get `Instance of type Response`

So you use `response.body`

![Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/response_body.gif](Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/response_body.gif)

So the response body is a lot more useful than just response . But it is still not as useful as a dictionary because you cannot query for specific stuff like `dict["a"]`

To be able to do this we need to convert the response to a Map, How to do it ? Use the JsonDecode in dart convert package

![Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/I_do_not_know_why_that_didnt_work.gif](Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8/I_do_not_know_why_that_didnt_work.gif)

I do not know why the above gif didnt work out , if all was correct then it should have printed it twice 

# What does a `build` function do ?

# How to use Shared Preference

---

So the demo code is 

```dart
import 'dart:async';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

class SharedPreferencesDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  SharedPreferencesDemo({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  SharedPreferencesDemoState createState() => SharedPreferencesDemoState();
}

class SharedPreferencesDemoState extends State<SharedPreferencesDemo> {
  Future<SharedPreferences> _prefs = SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  Future<int> _counter;

  Future<void> _incrementCounter() async {
    final SharedPreferences prefs = await _prefs;
    final int counter = (prefs.getInt('counter') ?? 0) + 1;

    setState(() {
      _counter = prefs.setInt("counter", counter).then((bool success) {
        return counter;
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _counter = _prefs.then((SharedPreferences prefs) {
      return (prefs.getInt('counter') ?? 0);
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text("SharedPreferences Demo"),
      ),
      body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder<int>(
              future: _counter,
              builder: (BuildContext context, AsyncSnapshot<int> snapshot) {
                switch (snapshot.connectionState) {
                  case ConnectionState.waiting:
                    return const CircularProgressIndicator();
                  default:
                    if (snapshot.hasError) {
                      return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
                    } else {
                      return Text(
                        'Button tapped ${snapshot.data} time${snapshot.data == 1 ? '' : 's'}.\n\n'
                            'This should persist across restarts.',
                      );
                    }
                }
              })),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _incrementCounter,
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: const Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Lets adress the `??` operator in dart , its called `is null` 

```dart
// Assign value to b if b is null; otherwise, b stays the same
b ??= value;
```

It can also be used in expressions 

```dart
String playerName(String name) => name ?? 'Guest';
// if name is null , it will return guest , if name is not null ,
//  it will return its value
```

So SharedPreference stores the data like a `Dictionary` in python or a `Map` in dart , ie , it stores using a `key-value` pair . 

So you first get an instance of the sharedpref

```dart
final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
```

And then to read an int you must have a key 

```dart
final myInt = prefs.getInt('my_int_key') ?? 0;
```

The `??` ensures that you get 0 if there is no value associated with that key yet

To write values 

```dart
prefs.setInt('my_int_key', 42);
```

But how do you create a key value pair ? Do you just set it ?

Yeah it seems so 

And also , all the `getInt` functions return a `Future<bool>` which means you can use the `a.then( (){})` to define what happens when you get it 

```dart
final SharedPreferences prefs = await _prefs;
```

They already have a `_pref` of Future type
then why assign another variable for it ?

# Streams

---

So suppose you have a stream  , lets not delve into how to make a stream but how to use it first. 

```dart
final mystream = ... // this is the stream
```

So how do we use it ? Much like a Future , A stream only returns one value at a time 

```dart
final subscription = mystream.listen( **(data) { print(data) ; }** )
```

So this function `listen` takes in a function ( in blue ) , and basically executes that function everytime a value comes through the stream 

So , how do you catch errors and values differently ?

Suppose you have two functions 

- `f1` - to execute when there is a value
- `f2` - to execute when there is an error

Then how will you use the listen method so as to use both these functions ?

```dart
final subscription = mystream.listen( 
	f1 , 
	onError: f2 ,
	cancelOnError: false,
)
```

The `cancelOnError` is true by default , when its true , it means the subscription will get cancelled when the stream recieves an error 

When `cancelOnError` is false , it means the subscription will keep going even if there is an error 

## what is StreamController

---

# Embed small apps in websites

---

so make a github gist with `main.dart` , then the gist url will look something like this 

```dart
https://gist.github.com/jcollins-g/**49bde0c1ed780decc902f3d4d06d8f0c**
```

Then you can just use 

```dart
https://dartpad.dev/**49bde0c1ed780decc902f3d4d06d8f0c**
```

to embed it !!!

## Text field in flutter

---

Create a controller 

```dart
final myController = TextEditingController();
```

Supply it to TexField 

```dart
TextField(
            controller: myController,

## Making  a Hero Widget  Implementation

SO I want to fly a custom text 

And it works with the following code 

[https://dartpad.dev/9939b06adf7903623c36158225944c12](https://dartpad.dev/9939b06adf7903623c36158225944c12)

Things , I couldnt do was , animate using the text inside the text Field , But I was able to animate from the title of appbar , 

But the animation was too fast , so I needed a way to slow it down , and this SO question helped me 

[How to change speed of a hero animation in flutter](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53727361/how-to-change-speed-of-a-hero-animation-in-flutter)

The answer was 

```dart
Navigator.push(
                  context,
                  PageRouteBuilder(
                      transitionDuration: Duration(seconds: 2),
                      pageBuilder: (_, __, ___) => Page2())),
            ),
```

But , this has a flaw , I cannot pass in arguments

## Gradients in Container

Dont do it with `color` property ,

Use the `decoration` property 

```dart
decoration : BoxDecoration( ... ),
```

What to put inside a `BoxDecoration` ? gradient property 

Dont include rive when using Linear Gradient , there is a LinearGradient there too , and it causes conflict
