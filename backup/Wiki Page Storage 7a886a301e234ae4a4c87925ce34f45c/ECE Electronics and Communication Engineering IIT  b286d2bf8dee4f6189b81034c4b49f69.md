I am assuming / attaching myself with IIT G ECE , even though its closing rank is 503 and my rank is 615 , there are more than 100 students between us , Which means there is almost no probablity that I will get it . But Lets have a neutral stance. 

Some important websites I have found is the [btech page IITG](https://www.iitg.ac.in/eee/acadbtech.html#acadbtechStart) 

And the course structure with syllabus is [over here (>2018)](http://iitg.ac.in/acad/CourseStructure/Btech2018/ECE.htm) 

This is the course structure for the first two semesters
