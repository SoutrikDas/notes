# As shown in the figure below the ideal gasses of equal amount substance are enclosed inside cylinders A and B ( S_A and S_B are cross sectional areas ) . the piston in A comes to rest at a distance L_A from A's base, and the piston in B comes to rest at distance L_B from B's base. The absolute temperature and pressure f the ideal gas inside B are T_B and p_B (and likewise for A ) . Ignore atmospheric pressure.

What does equal amounts of substance mean ? Are they meaning the mass is same or are they meaning the no. of moles is same ? 

I am a bit confused here 

# If equal amounts means $n_A=n_B$

then What can we say about the piston ? The pressure applied by Cyclinder A is equal to the pressure applied by cylinder B ? 

Probably not . Because even if the pressures are same , the force may not be . So the Piston may  still move . 

But when it stops , it must have force =0 

Which means 

$$p_A\times S_A=p_B\times S_B \tag 1$$

Where the LHS and RHS are the forces applied by the repsective sylinders 

we can use the fact that these are ideal

$$p_AV_A=n_ART_A$$

$$p_BV_B=n_BRT_B$$

Substituting these ideal gas equation into eqn 1 

$$\left( \frac{n_aRT_a}{V_a}\right)S_a=\left( \frac{n_bRT_b}{V_b}\right)S_b$$

Since $n_a=n_b$ 

$$\left( \frac{RT_a}{V_a}\right)S_a=\left( \frac{RT_b}{V_b}\right)S_b$$

and $V_a=S_a\times L_a$ 

$$\left( \frac{RT_a}{S_a\times L_a}\right)S_a=\left( \frac{RT_b}{S_b\times L_b}\right)S_b$$

$$\left( \frac{RT_a}{L_a}\right)=\left( \frac{RT_b}{L_b}\right)$$

Forgot to cut the $R$ 

$$\left( \frac{T_a}{L_a}\right)=\left( \frac{T_b}{L_b}\right)$$

$$T_aL_b=T_bL_a$$
