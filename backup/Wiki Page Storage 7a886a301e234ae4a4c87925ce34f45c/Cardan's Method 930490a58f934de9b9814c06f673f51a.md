# Description

Using this method you can find one root of any Cubic equation , thus reducing it to a qudratic equation which you can quickly solve.

## Q1 Solve by Cardans Method : $x^3-3x^2+ 12x + 16 = 0$

When you have $x^3+lx^2+mx+n=0$ then put $x=y-l/3$ 

Here we have $x^3-3x^2+ 12x + 16 = 0$ so we will put $x=y+1$ 

 

The objective to this step is to remove the $x^2$ term 

$$y^3+1+3y^2+3y-3(y^2+1+2y)+12y+12+16=0
\\
\implies 
y^3+3y^2-3y^2+3y-6y+12y+1-3+12+16
=0 
\\
\implies y^3+9y+26=0$$

$$y^3+9y+26=0 \tag1$$

Now to solve $y^3+9y+26=0$ 

We put $y=u+v$ , Cubing it we get 

$$y^3=u^3+v^3+3uv( \overbrace{u+v}^{y})$$

$$y^3-3uvy-(u^3+v^3)=0 \tag2$$

$$y^3+9y+26=0 \tag1$$

Comparing $(1)$ and $(2)$ we get 

$$uv=-3 \tag3$$

$$u^3+v^3=-26 \tag4$$

Now we Modify Equation $(3)$ a bit 

$$u^3v^3=-27 \tag{3'}$$

Now if you think of $u^3$ and $v^3$ as the roots of a quadratic equation , what equation will it be ? We can find that out because we have the product of the roots ( $u^3\times v^3=-27$ ) and the sum of the roots ( $u^3+v^3=-26$  )

So this quadratic equation becomes 

$$t^2+26t-27=0$$

Which gives 

$$u^3=\frac{-26+\sqrt{676+108}}{2}=\frac{-26+\sqrt{784}}{2}$$

$$u^3=\frac{-26+28}{2}=1$$

$$v^3=\frac{-26-28}{2}=-27$$

Grewal says that in this step we can get three values of u directly , $u=-3,-3\omega , -3 \omega^2$ which also makes sense , we can also get the values of v . But the preferred method is to find one root in a difficult way , then reduce the original equation to quadratic equation then solve it 

Hence we get 

$$u=1,v=-3$$

So we get 

$$y=-2$$

$$x_1=-1$$

Lets see if $-1$ is a root in our original equation

$$x^3-3x^2+ 12x + 16 = 0$$

$$-1-3-12 + 16 = 0 \tag{Yay!}$$

Now we can reduce this equation to 2 degree and solve it !

Here is the book's solution
