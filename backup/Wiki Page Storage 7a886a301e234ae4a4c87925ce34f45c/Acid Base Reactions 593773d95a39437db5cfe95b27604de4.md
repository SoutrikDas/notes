# Factors affecting the stability of charge

---

---

## What atom is the charge on ?

---

If you are comparing two atoms from the same row ( in periodic table ) then electronegativity is the deciding factor  ( more electronegativity , more stability ) , if you are comparing two atoms from same column then atoms size is the deciding factor ( more size better stability )

- In same row : $\text{Stability} \propto \!  Electronegativity$
- In same column : $\text{Stability } \propto \text{ Size }$

Now question arises , *What about **not in the same column or same row ?***

For that we will use both the **Electronegativity** and **Size** but the more weighty factor will be the former

Example : Lets compare $S^{\ominus}$ and $F^{\ominus}$ , 

- $F>S$ in terms of stability due to Electronegativity
- $F<S$ in terms of stability due to size

Net result ?  It **Should** be $F$ but no results on the web

## Resonance

1. The more delocalized the better. A charge spread over four atoms gives a more stable compound than a charge spread over two atoms, but

2. One oxygen is better than many carbon atoms

## Induction

---

When the factors above induction fail , then even something as small as this has the ability to affect the stability 

## Orbitals

David argues that all the above 3 factors wont be able to explain why the two hydrogen are of different acidity :

Our teacher taught us that triple bond means sp hybridised = more s % = more electronegtive , so the right carbanion ( in conjugate base ) would be more stable hence the right hydrogen is more acidic 

He argues that electrons being in an sp will be **more close to the nucleus thus stabilizing it**
