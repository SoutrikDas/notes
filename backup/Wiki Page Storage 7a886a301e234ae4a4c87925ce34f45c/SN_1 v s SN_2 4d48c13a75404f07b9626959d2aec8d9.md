There are four factors that determine whether a reaction will go via $SN_1$ or $SN_2$ 

# Always Total Inversion in SN$_2$ is a lie

---

> The phrase "inversion of configuration" may lead you to believe that the absolute configuration must switch after SN2 attack. This is not always true. Recall that absolute stereochemical configuration is determined via the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) system, and categorized with the labels "R" and "S." The absolute configuration inverts (from "R" to "S" or vice-versa) only when the nucleophile and leaving group have the same CIP priority relative to the other substituents. Since good nucleophiles and leaving gro ups tend towards equally high CIP priorities, most SN2 reactions do result in a switch of absolute configuration. If the nucleophile and leaving group have different relative CIP priorities, however, the absolute configuration does not necessarily change even though inversion occurs. Keep on your toes.

From [here](https://www.sparknotes.com/chemistry/organic4/sn2e2/section1/#:~:text=Purely%20SN2%20reactions,This%20is%20not%20always%20true.) 

# Factors determining the route

---

1. Electrophile 
2. Nucleophile 
3. Leaving Group
4. Solvent

# Electrophile

---

The electrophile is the compound being attacked by the nucleophile. In substitution
and elimination reactions (which we will see in the next chapter), we generally refer
to the electrophile as the substrate.

The question is, how many of these groups are alkyl groups (methyl, ethyl, propyl,
etc.)? We represent alkyl groups with the letter “R”. If there is one alkyl group, we call
the substrate “primary” (1°). If there are two alkyl groups, we call the substrate “secondary” (2°). And if there are three alkyl groups, we call the substrate “tertiary” (3°):

In an SN2 reaction, alkyl groups make it very crowded at the electrophilic center where the nucleophile needs to attack. If there are three alkyl groups, then it is virtually impossible for the nucleophile to get in and attack (this is an argument based on sterics):

# Nucelophile

---

The SN$_2$ being inititated by the nucleophie depends more on it , whereas the SN$_1$ is initiated by the Leaving group hence it is more neutral about the Nucleophile , it doesnt matter much to SN$_1$

![SN_1%20v%20s%20SN_2%204d48c13a75404f07b9626959d2aec8d9/Untitled%201.png](SN_1%20v%20s%20SN_2%204d48c13a75404f07b9626959d2aec8d9/Untitled%201.png)

We say that a weak nucleophile favours SN$_1$ but what we really mean is " A weak nucleophile disfavours SN$_2$

## What is a good nucleophile  ( and Leaving Group )

---

We know that the best Nucleophile is the worst Leaving Group and the Best Leaving group is the worst Nucleophile , explanation given here

$$\text{Leaving Group Power} \propto \frac 1 {\text{Nucleophilicity}}$$

So we just need to know how to rank Nucleophiles qualitatively , that way , we can also rank Leaving Groups qualitatively 

Here is how you rank them 

- No charge means weak Nucleophile

![SN_1%20v%20s%20SN_2%204d48c13a75404f07b9626959d2aec8d9/Untitled%202.png](SN_1%20v%20s%20SN_2%204d48c13a75404f07b9626959d2aec8d9/Untitled%202.png)

- Charge but stabilized  means good Nucleophile  ( Halogens with negative charge are very stable )

    ![SN_1%20v%20s%20SN_2%204d48c13a75404f07b9626959d2aec8d9/Untitled%203.png](SN_1%20v%20s%20SN_2%204d48c13a75404f07b9626959d2aec8d9/Untitled%203.png)

- Charged but unstabilized means excellent Nucleophile

    ![SN_1%20v%20s%20SN_2%204d48c13a75404f07b9626959d2aec8d9/Untitled%206.png](SN_1%20v%20s%20SN_2%204d48c13a75404f07b9626959d2aec8d9/Untitled%206.png)

# Leaving Group

---

Both SN$_1$ and SN$_2$ benefit from a better leaving group , but since SN$_1$ is more dependent on a Leaving group ( because LG initiates SN1  and is also present in its RDS ) therefore when Leaving group is excellent then SN$_1$ is more favoured ( slightly more than SN$_2$ )

![SN_1%20v%20s%20SN_2%204d48c13a75404f07b9626959d2aec8d9/Untitled%208.png](SN_1%20v%20s%20SN_2%204d48c13a75404f07b9626959d2aec8d9/Untitled%208.png)

If you use a bad leaving group , neither of the reaction will happen 

> Something that is a bad nucleophile is a good leaving group . Why ? Play SN2 in your head ,
Forward: Nu attacks LG leaves
Reverse : LG attacks Nu leaves
So essentially they are same . if LG is a better better Nucleophile than the attacking Nu then it would go in reverse, so LG to be a good leaving group ( hence go forward ) it has to be a bad Nucleophile

Here is how you rank Leaving Groups 

- No charge means Excellent Leaving Group

![SN_1%20v%20s%20SN_2%204d48c13a75404f07b9626959d2aec8d9/Untitled%202.png](SN_1%20v%20s%20SN_2%204d48c13a75404f07b9626959d2aec8d9/Untitled%202.png)

- Charge but stabilized  means good Leaving Group  ( Halogens with negative charge are very stable )

- Charged but unstabilized means Very bad Leaving Groups

Whenever you are assessing a leaving group or a nucleophile to determine how stable it is, you need to look at what it looks like when it is not attached to the molecule. In other words, how stable is it when it is by itself.

# Solvent

---

polar aprotic solvents favor SN2 reactions

Why ? 

First lets see about the **Polar** part of Polar Aprotic

> SN1 desperately needs the polar solvent to stabilize the carbocation, and SN2 needs a polar solvent to dissolve the nucleophile. SN1 certainly needs the polar solvent more than SN2 does, but you will rarely see a substitution reaction in a nonpolar solvent.

Now lets focus on the **aprotic** of Polar Aprotic 

> Aprotic means that the solvent does not have a proton on an electronegative atom. The solvent can still have hydrogen atoms, but none of them are connected to electronegative atoms. The most common examples of polar aprotic solvents are acetone, DMSO, DME, and DMF

![SN_1%20v%20s%20SN_2%204d48c13a75404f07b9626959d2aec8d9/Untitled%2011.png](SN_1%20v%20s%20SN_2%204d48c13a75404f07b9626959d2aec8d9/Untitled%2011.png)

Common Polar Aprotic Solvents

So why does a **polar aprotic solvent favour SN$_2$ ?**

> Because of Solvent Effect . A nucleophile with a charge when dissolved in a Solvent will be surrounded by solvent molecules in what is called a *solvent shell.*
This solvent shell is in the way, *holding back the nucleophile from doing what is supposed to do* (go attack something). For the nucleophile to do its job, the nucleophile must first shed this solvent shell. This is always the case when you dissolve a nucleophile in a polar solvent, except when you use a polar aprotic solvent. The crux is :
**Polar aprotic solvents are not very good at forming solvent shells around negative charges**
