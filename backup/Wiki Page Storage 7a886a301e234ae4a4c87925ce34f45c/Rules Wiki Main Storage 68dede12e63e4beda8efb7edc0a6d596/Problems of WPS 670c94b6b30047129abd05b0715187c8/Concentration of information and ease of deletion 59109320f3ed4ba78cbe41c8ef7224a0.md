# Concentration of information and ease of deletion

most of the important information is within relations , and its so easy to delete a column if the page is not locked , what does that mean ? You take a year to form a functional linked database and then by mistake you delete one column of information and everything crumbles , there is no second chance as of now  ( unless you pay ) No backup and all ,

Now the only way I can find a solution to this problem is to 

- not concentrate information in one column but spread it
- or concentrate information in one column but create a backup
