This is a book about flutter 

# Chapter 4 : Flutter UI , Important widgets ,themes and layout

---

In this chapter, in particular, we’ll look at these high-level categories:

-  Structural widgets that outline the app.
-  Themes and styling, which this app is heavy on. We’ll set the custom color scheme and look at the MediaQuery class to help with styling.
-  Widgets that help with layout. This broad category includes building-block widgets like Table, Stack, and BoxConstraint, as well as some fantastic convenience widgets like TabBar, which provide features for free.
-  Additional layout widgets, specifically ListView. This widget can be scrollable and uses something called the builder pattern in Flutter.
