# Consider a spherical gaseous cloud of mass density \rho(r) in free space where r is the radial distance from its center. The gaseous cloud is made of particles of equal mass m moving in circular orbits around the common center with the same kinetic energy K  The force acting on the particles is their mutual gravitational force. If \rho(r) is constant with time , the particle density n(r)=\rho (r)/m is ?

Go to radius $r$ 

the particles revolving there have some centripetal force 

who is giving them this centripetal force ? The gravitational force 

So 

If we find how much gravitational force  the mass inside the sphere exerts on that small dM at radius r and balance it
