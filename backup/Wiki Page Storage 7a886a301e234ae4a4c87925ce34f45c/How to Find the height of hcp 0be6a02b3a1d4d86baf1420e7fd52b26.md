This question can be changed to "How to find the height of a tetrahedra;" 

Because:

Let this AD be a , then We need to find $AG$

To do that lets first find $DG$ 

Since $DG$ is the Centroid we know that $DG$ is $\frac 23 ( a \frac {\sqrt 3}{2})$ , ie $a/\sqrt 3$

Now using pythagorus theorem  we get 

$$\frac {a^2}{3}+x^2=a^2$$

Therefore $x=\frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 3}a$

Now in a HCP , there are basically two tetrahedrals 

Here is the first Tetrahedral

First tetrahedral

Second tetrahedral

And each side of these tetrahedrals are $2R$ hence the height of a tetrahedral is $\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}2R$

and the height of two tetrahedrals , hence the hcp is 

$$h=4\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}R$$
