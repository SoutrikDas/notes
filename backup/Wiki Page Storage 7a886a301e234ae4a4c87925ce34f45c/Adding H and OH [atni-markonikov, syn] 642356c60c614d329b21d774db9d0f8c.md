# Mechanism

A pi bond is a site of high electron density, and therefore, a pi bond can attack borane. In fact, this is the first step of our mechanism. A pi bond attacks the empty p orbital of boron, which triggers a simultaneous hydride shift

We are adding H and BH2 across the double bond. BH2 is bigger and bulkier than H, so it will have an easier time fitting over the less substituted carbon (the less sterically hindered position)

Both BH2 and H are adding simultaneously, so they must end up on the same face of the alkene. In other words, the reaction must be a syn addition.
