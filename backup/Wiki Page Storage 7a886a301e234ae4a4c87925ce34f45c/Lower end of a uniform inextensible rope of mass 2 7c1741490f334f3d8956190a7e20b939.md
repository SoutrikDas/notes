# Lower end of a uniform inextensible rope of mass 2 kg and length 4m is attached to a block of mass 7.5kg placed on a horizontal floor. \mu=0.5. The uppoer end of the rope is held 2m above the lower end so that the tangent at the lower end remains horizontal.In this situation , the block stays standstill on the floor. g=10

What we have 

- $m_r=2kg$
- $m_b=7.5 kg$
- $l_r=4m$ Full length
- $h$ =2m ,

What we can derive 

- Maximum Friction force $f_{max}=75/2=37.5 N$

But we dont know if in the initial setup , all of the friction force is being exerted .

So the $\sin$ component will balance out the weight of the rope ( because there is nothing else )

$$f=T_2=T_1 \cos \theta$$

$$m_lg=T_1\sin \theta$$

Maybe we can integrate and find out something about $T_1 \cos \theta$ , but we dont know the shape ( semi circle or parabola or something else ?)
