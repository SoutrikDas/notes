Magnetic Needle's North pole always alingns in the direction of Magnetic Field ( if it is allowed to freely move in any direction )

- [North Geomagnetic Pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Magnetic_Pole#North_Geomagnetic_Pole) – the point of intersection of the Earth's surface with the axis of a simple magnetic dipole (like a bar magnet) that best approximates the Earth's actual more complex magnetic field.

Explanation by Alakh Pandey Sir, [(Geo)Magnetic North Pole](https://youtu.be/aII3lnSQqiU?t=1445)  [(Geo)Magnetic South Pole](https://youtu.be/aII3lnSQqiU?t=1529) , In the video he speaks of them as North Magnetic and South Magnetic Pole , but in  WikiPedia the case where earth's magnetism is depicted by simple magnetic dipole is called as Geomagnetic North/South Pole

All the North Poles are made clear over [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole_(disambiguation)) :

- [North Pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole) (also known as the "Geographic North Pole" or "Terrestrial North Pole") – the point in the [Northern Hemisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere) where the [Earth's axis of rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation) meets its surface.
- [North Magnetic Pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Magnetic_Pole) – the shifting point on the Earth's surface where the Earth's magnetic field points directly downwards.
- [North Geomagnetic Pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Magnetic_Pole#North_Geomagnetic_Pole) – the point of intersection of the Earth's surface with the axis of a simple magnetic dipole (like a bar magnet) that best approximates the Earth's actual more complex magnetic field.
- [Northern Pole of Inaccessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_of_inaccessibility) – the point in the Arctic Ocean farthest from land.
- [North Celestial Pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_pole) – an imaginary point in the northern sky towards which the Earth's axis of rotation points.
