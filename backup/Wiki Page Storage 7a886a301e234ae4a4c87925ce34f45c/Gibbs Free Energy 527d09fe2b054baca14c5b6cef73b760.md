$$-\Delta G ^{\ominus}=2.303RT \log K$$

The significance of this one small equation is very useful , but also very common-sensical

You might have heard your teachers saying that having a $\Delta G <0$ means that the reaction is feasable , or **spontaneous** . But what does that have to do with $K$ ?

To understand that we have to understand that every reaction , [EVERY REACTION , is an equilibrium](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/47262/is-every-chemical-reaction-in-equilibrium).

$$A \to B  \ \text{is really} \ A \rightleftharpoons B \ \text{with a really big K}$$

As a rule of Thumb , Reactions having $K>10^3$ is considered to be an irreversible reactions

From Robert Grossman's Book "The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanism-Springer" - 1998

So every Reaction has a equilibrium constant. 

### Significance of  $-\Delta G ^{\ominus}=2.303RT \log K$

![Gibbs%20Free%20Energy%20527d09fe2b054baca14c5b6cef73b760/Untitled%201.png](Gibbs%20Free%20Energy%20527d09fe2b054baca14c5b6cef73b760/Untitled%201.png)

Fig 1 , $\Delta G=-50$

Fig 2 , $\Delta G=-100$

Obviously Looking at the graph you can understand that the product in Fig 2 is more stable that in Fig 1. but this can also be explained by the equilibrium constant because from the equation $\Delta G ^{\ominus}=2.303RT \log K$ we get that

$$K_2=K_1^2$$

So the reaction of Fig 2 ends up farther in the right .

So how does it make Fig 2 more stable ? Having a higher eq Constant means it leaves less reactant , and forms more equivalents of the product . (But maybe thats not a good explanation)
