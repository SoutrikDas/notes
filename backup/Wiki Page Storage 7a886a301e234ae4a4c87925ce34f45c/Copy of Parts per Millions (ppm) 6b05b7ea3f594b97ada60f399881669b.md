Parts Per Million is unitless 

Its calculated using the mass of a solute and solvent ( not necessarily liquid) 

Suppose you are given $m_a$ as solute  mass and $m_b$ as solvent mass ( both in same units ) 

Then check the ratio $\cfrac{\cfrac{m_a}{m_b}}{1}$ , which means that for every 1 unit of Solvent there is $\cfrac{m_a}{m_b}$ unit of solute . Now we just have to see how many units of solute is there for $10^6$ ( million ) units of Solvent .

And for that we multiply the ratio $\cfrac{\cfrac{m_a}{m_b}}{1}$ with $1000,000$ to make the no. Of units of solvent to a million 

So we are getting 

$$\cfrac{\overbrace{\cfrac{m_a}{m_b}\times10^6}^{\text{for 10$^6$ of solvent we have this much of solute }}}{10^6}$$

So our ppm is 

$$\cfrac{m_a}{m_b} \times 10^6$$

THe question doest say that $FeSO_4.7H_2O$  is of 10 ppm in 100 kg of wheat . 

It says that $FeSO_4.7H_2O$ has some mass , it has some ppm , due to which Iron $Fe$ has 10 ppm in $100kg$ .

Now if we think that $100kg$ is a million part , then each of our individual part would be $\cfrac{100,000}{1000,000}g=\cfrac{1}{10}gram$ So 10 parts is $1g$ . and for 1 gram of Fe We can say there is $\cfrac{1}{55.85}$ moles of $Fe$ which means there are that many moles of the salt ( ferrous sulphate heptahydrate ) So weight of the salt = $\text{weight of 1 mol of salt } \times \text{no. of mols of salt }$ 

$$\cfrac{1}{55.85} \times ( 55.85+32+4*16+7*18)=4.97$$
