Initiator of the reaction : The double bond thats about to die, initiates the reaction , its kind of a suicide

Suppose we have this 

![Adding%20H%20and%20X%20%5BMarkonikov,oos%5D%20faa09357d9ea49549a80b8715da440f9/Untitled%202.png](Adding%20H%20and%20X%20%5BMarkonikov,oos%5D%20faa09357d9ea49549a80b8715da440f9/Untitled%202.png)

Then , we have two choices 

![Adding%20H%20and%20X%20%5BMarkonikov,oos%5D%20faa09357d9ea49549a80b8715da440f9/Untitled%203.png](Adding%20H%20and%20X%20%5BMarkonikov,oos%5D%20faa09357d9ea49549a80b8715da440f9/Untitled%203.png)

First choice 

![Adding%20H%20and%20X%20%5BMarkonikov,oos%5D%20faa09357d9ea49549a80b8715da440f9/Untitled%204.png](Adding%20H%20and%20X%20%5BMarkonikov,oos%5D%20faa09357d9ea49549a80b8715da440f9/Untitled%204.png)

Second choice

The second choice looks better because the carbocation is more stable , and from [Hammond's Postulate ](Hammond's%20Postulate%20af25b91f7adb4392bbf7f457fba353dc.md) we know that if the intermediate is more stable , that means the transition state is more stable , which means the activation energy is less , which means this is faster 

Hence this is kinematically favoured product . 

And the icing on the cake is that this product is also thermodynamically more stable because of more alpha hydrogen ( hyperconjugation ) 

But why is more alpha hydrogen means more stability? [Alkene ](Alkene%20b86fd97510ab430bb28bd6bd418bf6f2.md) 

> You will probably not see an example where two new stereocenters are formed, because the stereochemical outcome in such a case is complex
and is beyond the scope of our conversation.

![Adding%20H%20and%20X%20%5BMarkonikov,oos%5D%20faa09357d9ea49549a80b8715da440f9/Untitled%205.png](Adding%20H%20and%20X%20%5BMarkonikov,oos%5D%20faa09357d9ea49549a80b8715da440f9/Untitled%205.png)

So atmost there will only be two products that will be formed

The mechanism also provides explanation as to why some reaction go through rearrangements 

( Because the mechanism proceeds through most stable carbocation , therefore , sometimes when the compound gets an oppurtunity to get to increase the stability of the carbocation , it will rearrange ) 

 

There are two common ways for a carbocation to rearrange: either through a hydride
shift or through a methyl shift. Keep in mind that any reaction going through carbocation mechanism has a chance for rearrangement
