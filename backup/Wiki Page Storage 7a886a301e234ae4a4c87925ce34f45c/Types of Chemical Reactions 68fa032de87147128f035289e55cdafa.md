In this page there are several Classifications of Chemical Reactions 

1. [Grossman's Four Fundamental Reaction](https://www.notion.so/Types-of-Chemical-Reactions-68fa032de87147128f035289e55cdafa#acefd5d3a6914d478f2dbde107e625f7)

## Grossman's Four Fundamental Reaction

- Addition
- Elimination
- Substitution
- Rearrangement

Here are the Respective Descriptions

- In an addition reaction, two starting materials combine to give a single product. Usually a rr bond in one starting material is replaced by two new a bonds.
- In an elimination reaction, one starting material is divided into two products. Usually two a bonds in one starting inaterial are replaced by a new n-bond.
- In a substitution reaction, an atom or group that is a-bound to the rest of the starting material is replaced by another a-bound atom or group.
- In a rearrangement, one starting material gives one product with a different structure

After Classifying he also goes on to say 

> Some transformations constitute examples of more than one of these classes. For example, the reaction of esters with Grignard reagents gives alcohols in what is a substitution and an addition reaction.
