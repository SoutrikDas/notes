Alcohols are generally bad leaving groups  , so people convert alcohols to tosylate or mesylate , when they want it to leave 

- But we can also use concentrated acid , to do [Removing OH and H : Acid Catalyzed DeHydration [zaitsev]](Removing%20OH%20and%20H%20Acid%20Catalyzed%20DeHydration%20%5Bzait%20df170e3acf564a559bccd42ed13cdf6c.md) So why dont we do it ?

     We dont do it if later on in the synthesis , we are going to have to use a base 

    For example
