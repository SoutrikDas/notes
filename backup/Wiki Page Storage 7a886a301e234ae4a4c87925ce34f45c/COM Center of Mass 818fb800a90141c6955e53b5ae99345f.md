# Definition

$$x_{com}=\frac{\int xdm}{\int dm}$$

# Law of Conservation of momentum

---

Since 

$$F_{net}=\frac{dp}{dt}$$

When the net external force acting on a system of bodies becomes 0 , then we can say 

$$0=\frac{dp}{dt}$$

or , there is no change in momentum , or "Momemtum is conserved " 

## Why can we conserve momentum inpresence of non-impulsive forces

Q: The rocket has one external force acting on it , and that is gravity , so why can we conserve momentum ? What is the condition for conserving momentum ?

The thing is , if the force is impulsive ( very high force for a very short interval ) then you cannot conserve ( in the presence of such a force ) , but if the force present is non impulsive , like gravity , then you can conserve it , why because 

$$\frac {dp}{dt}=F_{net}$$

When in presence of gravity an explosion occurs , $F_{net}=F_{int}+F_g$ but the sum of internal forces is $0$ , so $F_{net}=-Mg$ 

$$\frac {dp}{dt}=-Mg$$

$$\Delta p =-Mg\Delta t$$

But the collision happens for a very short duration , if we take $\Delta t \to 0$ then we find that 

$$\Delta p \to 0$$

Which would explain why in presence of some forces the momentum remains same 

But if we only look at one body in a collision , we will find that The $F_{in}$ is not summing up to $0$ 

So from impulse theorem 

$$dp=\int F_{net} dt$$

But here , if we say that $dt$ is very small , so again there is no change in momentum , then that would be wrong , because here there is change in momentum , and the reason for that is a very high $F_{net}$ , so high , that in a very small time it can do significant amount of change in momentum

Can momentum be conserved from different frames ? also , what are inertial and non inertial frames ?
