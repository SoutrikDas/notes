# Spring Force

---

In our syllabus , most of the springs are massless ( but at the end there is one or two , who make you have the equivalent mass = $m/3$ of the spring ) 

- The force in the spring at every point , is same
- Cutting a String makes the Tension go to zero very quick , but if that system has springs , and you cut strings , then the spring force doesnt change so quickly

- But if the system has astrings and springs , and you cut the spring , then the $F_{sp}$ will become $0$ very quickly
    - And when the spring is cut , just after that $F_sp=0$ but the amazing thing is , the tension ( in string ) starts to change , it changes very quickly ( because tension is a self adjusting forces)  , But why will the tension change ? According to what will the tension change ?
    - It will change according to the fact that
