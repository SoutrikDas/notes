# Postulates of Bohr atomic Model

---

- Atom has a center called Nucleus ( Rutherford also said this )
- Electron revolves only in fixed circular orbits with fixed velocity with fixed energy ( Rutherford said only " circular orbits" not fixed )

So how do you find those fixed circular orbits ? 

- Quantisation Condition :
    - Electrons Revolve only in those circular orbits for which the angular momentum $(L=mvr)$  is integral multiple of $\frac h {2\pi}$

    $$\newcommand{\z}[1]{\frac{#1 h}{2\pi}}
    L=\z1,\z2,\z3,\cdots$$

    $$L=\frac{nh}{2\pi}$$

    $$mvr=\frac{nh}{2\pi} \tag 1$$

    Where 

    - $n$ is Principal [Quantum Numbers ](Quantum%20Numbers%20f326f1060c674ed1b89af44ec6a1d698.md), it  denotes the shell number
    - $h$ is Planck's Constant

But Quantisation condition has three variables , $v$ , $r$ , $n$ , if only we have two , can we find the other , but generally we want to find radius and velocity based only on the $n$ . So what do we use for that ? 

- While revolving the electrostatic force between nucleus and electron provides centripetal force ( Centripetal force is the inward real force , Centrifugal is outward imaginary force )

$$k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}=\frac{mv^2}{r}$$

$$k\frac{(ze)(e)}{r^2}=\frac{mv^2}{r}$$

- While revolving in a particular orbit , an electron neither gains energy nor looses energy ( Maxwell said otherwise )  . Energy of a Shell is Fixed . That is why he named these shells Stationary energy levels  and he named them $k,l,m,n,o$
