Right now I want to put the POST request , what its about , but as this page grows I want to learn more about subnet masks , IP addresses and MAC adress

So we are making POST request , what is even POST  , is it somewhat related to REST ? Seems fishy lets find out 

OKay so POST and REST are not directly related , instead I found these 

POST vs PUT 

- POST - when you want to create a new resource
- PUT - when you want to update an existing resource

There are four common http method GET , PUT , POST , DELETE
