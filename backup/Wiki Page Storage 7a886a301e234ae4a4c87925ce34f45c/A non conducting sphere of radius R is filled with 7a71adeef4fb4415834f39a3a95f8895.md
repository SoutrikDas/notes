for a sphere at center , what would the equation be ?

$$\frac{kqr}{R^3} \times \hat r$$

Why because let the density be $\rho$ , then charge in $r$ is 

$$\frac 43 \pi r^3 \rho$$

$$\frac{k4 \pi r^3 \rho}{3r^2}$$

$$\frac{ \rho}{3 \epsilon _0} \times \vec r$$

Then for the answer of this question we will have 

$$\frac{ (-\rho)}{3 \epsilon _0} \times (\vec r-\vec d)$$

$$\frac{}{}$$
