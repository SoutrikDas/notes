So the problem I am having is not of logic but of handling the string or array actually.

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int n;
	int c=0;
	cin>>n;
	char input[6];
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
		cin>>input;
		// we want 0 2 4
		if((***stoi(input[0])***+stoi(input[2])+stoi(input[4]))>=2){
			c++;
		}

	}
	cout<<c;
	return 0;
}
```

The error I am getting is probably because of the `stoi()` . Although people are saying its implemented in C++11 , I am using gnu C++17 compiler , so I dont see why it wouldnt have worked ( maybe they deprecated it ?)

```cpp
no matching function for call to 'stoi(char&)'
```

So probably its because I am feeding it an element of my array , when the function is probably expecting a string.

So if I change the code 

From `char input[6];` to `string input;` , now `input[0]` should be a string ? It probably still is a character. 

But the problem has changed a little bit : 

```cpp
no matching function for call
 to 'stoi(__gnu_cxx::__alloc_traits<std::allocator<char> >::value_type&)'
```

What is this?

## Using ASCII to convert

---

If I am not wrong , each number will have an ASCII which I can exploit

```cpp
char zero='0';
int a=zero;
// a is 48
```

# Solution

---

The solution was to use int variables to take input 

like so 

```cpp
int a, b,c;
for ...
	cin>>a>>b>>c;
```

and it seems it does assign all the proper numbers to proper variables.
