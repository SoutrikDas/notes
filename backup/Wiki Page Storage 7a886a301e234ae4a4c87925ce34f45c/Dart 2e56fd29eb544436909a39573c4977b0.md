[https://dartpad.dev/](https://dartpad.dev/)

So the first piece of code that we see is 

```dart
void main() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    print('hello ${i + 1}');
  }
}
```

From this alone we can see that, to get the value of a variable we use `${var}` 

Another thing we can see is that statements are ended with `;` so this kind of syntax is almost from `C++` , Even the void main

# Variables

---

Dart is statically declared programming language , meaning if I create a string variable , I cannot change the data type to int later on ( just like `C++` )

How to declare them ?

```dart
int age = 30 ;
```

## Dynamic

---

Although its a static language , you can declare dynamic data type 

```dart
dynamic name="Soutrik";
name=30;
print(name);
```

This will print `30` without error !

# Comments

```dart
// just like c++
```

# Functions

---

 The main function is always executed in dart 

The function definition is exactly like C++

```dart
<return type> <function name> ( <args>) {
...
}
```

## Arrow functions

---

If we are just going to return then we can make this 

```dart
<return type> <function name> (){
	return "Hello";
}
```

To 

```dart
<return type> <function name> => "Hello" ;
```

And it would do exactly the same thing !

But its not just that , if we have 

```dart
void main()
{
	runApp( MyApp() );
}
```

We can do this 

```dart
void main() => runApp( MyApp() ) ;
```

# List

---

Its just like an array 

```dart
List name=["Soutrik" , "Corvo" , "Attano"];
//Output: [Soutrik, Corvo, Attano]
```

Make a list for a particular datatype 

```dart
List<String> name=["Soutrik" , "Corvo" , "Attano"];
```

`String` is the datatypes for string and not `string`

## Add to list

---

```dart
name.add("Das");
//if we print it now we get : [Soutrik, Corvo, Attano, Das]

```

But we could also add an integer 

```dart
name.add(30);
// if we print now we get :[Soutrik, Corvo, Attano, 30]
```

But this is bad practice , to jumble up data types in a list , so what we do is during declaration we define the datatype that will be in the list [like so](https://www.notion.so/soutrik/Dart-2e56fd29eb544436909a39573c4977b0#db6c3f1948d543eabc9518ee3828d607)

# Class

---

How to make a class ?

```dart
Class <name of class> {

}
```

We can define a constructor just like in c++

```dart
Class User {
	int age;
	User( int age){
		this.age=age;
		
	}
}
```

## How to inherit ?

---

```dart
class <name of class 2> extends <name of class 1> {
...
}
```

Where the class 2 extends from class 1 

But inheritance is a bit complicated 

For example if you have a class called User 

```dart
Class User {
	String username;
	int age;
	void login(){
		print("User logged in");
	}
	User( String username, int age ){
		this.username=username;
		this.age=age;
	}
}
```

And then we inherit it into a new Class 

```dart
Class SuperUser extends User {
}
```

But now the problem is , how do we create the constructor of a super user ?

```dart
Class SuperUser extends User {
	SuperUser( String username, int age ){
		**this.username=username; ?
		this.age=age; ?**
	}
}
```

And the answer is , NO , we do  not do it like that  . Because those variables ( `username` and `age` ) are not declared in `SuperUser` rather its declared in the `User` class , so we need to call `User` 's constructor , how do we do that ?

Well actually there is a handy function called `super`

```dart
Class SuperUser extends User {
	SuperUser( String username, int age ) : **super**(username,age);
}
```

What it basically does is call the parent class's Constructor and pass those variables in 

## How to create objects ?

---

```dart
SuperUser me = SuperUser("Soutrik" ,18);
```

Where `SuperUser` is a class 

# Map ( Dictionary in python )

```dart
Map student ={ "name" : "Soutrik", "age" : 18}
print(student["name"]) // output: Soutrik
```

# Make a function have async await code

![Dart%202e56fd29eb544436909a39573c4977b0/async_await_function.gif](Dart%202e56fd29eb544436909a39573c4977b0/async_await_function.gif)

## convert int to string

```dart
int intValue = 1;
String stringValue = intValue.toString();
String hexValue = intValue.toRadixString(16);
```
