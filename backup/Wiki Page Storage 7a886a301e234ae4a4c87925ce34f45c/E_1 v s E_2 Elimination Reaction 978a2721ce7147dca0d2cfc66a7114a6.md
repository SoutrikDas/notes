# Factors on which E1 and E2 depends

---

---

## Substrate

---

In SN reactions , specifically SN2 , the reaction couldnt be done with tertiary substrate  because of the steric arguement ( " its becoming too bulky for the Nu to reach the carbon " ) but in the case of Electrophile , the Base doesnt need to reach the carbon, rather it needs to pluc a hydrogen off from the next carbon . 

there fore This steric arguement is NOT-AT-ALL a factor for E2 , so we might expect some constant behaviour , no matter the substrate ,right ? Yeah we do !

But how would you know if that constant behaviour is good behaviour ( high rxn rate ) or bad behaviour ? For now we dont have an answer to that , so we have to accept that its a high reaction rate for all substrates 

![E_1%20v%20s%20E_2%20Elimination%20Reaction%20978a2721ce7147dca0d2cfc66a7114a6/Untitled.png](E_1%20v%20s%20E_2%20Elimination%20Reaction%20978a2721ce7147dca0d2cfc66a7114a6/Untitled.png)

What about E1 ? Well it still makes the carbocation , hence its rate of reaction does depend upon the stability of the carbocation ( [Hammond's Postulate ](Hammond's%20Postulate%20af25b91f7adb4392bbf7f457fba353dc.md)) Hence the rate is highest for 3 degree .

Bottom line : 

- Primary - E2
- Secondary - E2
- Tertiary - Both ( depends on the next factor )

## Basicity

---

The more basic a base is ( doesnt mean that its going to be fast ) 

Why do we even need a base ? The E1 only needs a base to abstract the proton at the end . But E2 needs it to start the reaction , hence Basic strength matters more to E2

![E_1%20v%20s%20E_2%20Elimination%20Reaction%20978a2721ce7147dca0d2cfc66a7114a6/Untitled%201.png](E_1%20v%20s%20E_2%20Elimination%20Reaction%20978a2721ce7147dca0d2cfc66a7114a6/Untitled%201.png)

Although more basicity is not kinetically faster then why is the reaction rate increasing for E2 ?

Bottom line : 

- weak Base - Disfavours E2  ( hence suggests E1 )
- Moderate Base - Both
- Strong Base - E2

## Leaving Group

---

As in SN , E1 is a bit more sensitive to this 

![E_1%20v%20s%20E_2%20Elimination%20Reaction%20978a2721ce7147dca0d2cfc66a7114a6/Untitled%202.png](E_1%20v%20s%20E_2%20Elimination%20Reaction%20978a2721ce7147dca0d2cfc66a7114a6/Untitled%202.png)

Bottom line :

- Bad LG - Neither
- Good LG - Both
- Excellent LG - E1

# Regiochemistry

> the E1 mechanism favors Zaitsev’s product and we cannot change this regioselectivity even if a sterically hindered alcohol is used as a weak base. But we can change it for E2

But question is why does E1 not give a hoffman product even if we use a sterically hindered base ? Why is it regioselective ??

Usually you get the Zaitsev product, but under
special circumstances you can get the Hoffman product ( only for E2 ) . If you use a strong, sterically
hindered base, you can form the Hoffman product ( only for E2 )

# Stereochemistry

---

In Summary 

- E2 Will have anti elimination ( if there are cis/trans isomers, you will get the one determined by the H and LG being antiperiplanar (draw Newman projections ) )
- E1 will have both ( so it will form both cis and trans )

## Anti Stereochemistry Elimination in E2

---

Suppose you have this , and are asked to tell if the product is going to cis or trans 

![E_1%20v%20s%20E_2%20Elimination%20Reaction%20978a2721ce7147dca0d2cfc66a7114a6/Untitled%204.png](E_1%20v%20s%20E_2%20Elimination%20Reaction%20978a2721ce7147dca0d2cfc66a7114a6/Untitled%204.png)

First of all we want to know if it will go via E1 or E2 

- Secondary substrate =  E2 ( How do you know its secondary ? I mean it can also attack on the tertiary one no ? ) ( anything is E2 compatible but for E1 you need a 3rd degree , by 3rd degree I mean the carbocation has to be 3rd degree , here it is not , hence E2 )
- Strong ( unstabilized and $\ominus$ charged base ) = E2
- Good LG = Both

Hence it will go via E2 

Now what are the specialities of E2 ?

- Single step
- Rate depends upon base and substrate
- ⭐ E2 is stereospecific = Anti Elimination

Then your first question would be 

> But the Hydrogen is cis with the Chlorine , how the hell can there be anti elimination ??

And the answer is bond rotation / conformation

This is the beauty , the application of Newman figures .  I never thought this would have any use outside Isomerism chapter, but here we are !
