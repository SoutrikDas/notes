Highly concentrated Acid 

Because if you remove water from the following Equilibrium , you will favour the backward reaction , which is [Removing OH and H : Acid Catalyzed DeHydration [zaitsev]]()

# Mechanism : $E_1$

This is the mechanism for the [Adding H and OH ,  Acid Catalyzed Hydration [Markonikov, oos]](Adding%20H%20and%20OH%20,%20Acid%20Catalyzed%20Hydration%20%5BMarkon%2055ac132ae66e46bbb533165e1257bcf8.md)

# Regiochemistry

---

To understand this we need to take a look at the regiochemistry of $E_1$ 

To do this lets go over [here](https://www.notion.so/E_1-v-s-E_2-Elimination-Reaction-978a2721ce7147dca0d2cfc66a7114a6#fdc0028afdc1423fb9615e405b24e807) 

It basically says that 

Usually you get the Zaitsev product, but under
special circumstances you can get the Hoffman product. If you use a strong, sterically
hindered base, you can form the Hoffman product.

So why do you usually get a Zaitsev product ? Because it undergoes the formation of a carbocation 

Cannot form Hoffman in E1 , usually people only use E2 for Hoffman , E1 is only used for Zaitsev ,

But it can give hoffman , its just not preffered

Nope , there arent 4 groups attached after the reaction is done
