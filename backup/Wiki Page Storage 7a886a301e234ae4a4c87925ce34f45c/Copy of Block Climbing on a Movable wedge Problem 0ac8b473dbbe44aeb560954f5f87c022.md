The three questions are 

1. Find the velocity of Block after it comes down From WEdge B
2. Find the max Height it can go upto in wedge C
3. Find the Speed of The block after it comes down from wedge C

So the First Question is easy to answer Because From the State where The block was ON The wedge to where it went off , The momentum in X axis or $\vec i$ can be conserved so we get the relation of velocity from that . Then we can use work Energy theorem and distribute the work done into the respective proportions

Work done by gravity =

$$W_g=+m_agh$$

Then this work is distributed as follows

$$m_agh= \frac{1}{2}m_av_a^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_b   \left( \overbrace{\frac{m_av_a}{m_b}}^{\text{$v_b$ }}\right)^2$$

 The second Question is workable if we know the velocity of approach , ie the velocity of Block A after descending from B . That speed lets suppose is v_a in this context

$$m_av_a=(m_a+m_c)v_{common} \\
v_{common}=\frac{m_av_a}{m_a+m_c}$$

But how will you find the Height ? The solution is that THe -ve work that gravity did on the system has shown itself via the loss of Kinetic Energy , that means we can use Work Energy theorem to get height

$$KE_f-KE_i=-m_agh \quad \text{here $h$ is freshly used }$$

$$\frac{1}{2} (m_a+m_c)v_{common}^2 -\frac{1}{2}m_av_a^2=m_agh$$

The third part is Confusing

Forget all context ,here $v_a$ is the final velocity of A in positive x dirn .and it is currently at height $h$ and both are moving at $v_{common}$ ( and we know the value of $v_{common}$ )

$$(m_a +m_c)v_{common}=m_av_a+m_cv_c$$

from this we kinda get a relation between $v_a$ and $v_c$ because we already know $v_{common}$

$$\frac{(m_a +m_c)v_{common}-m_av_a}{m_c}=v_c$$

So now we can put it into 

$$\left(\overbrace{\frac{1}{2}m_av_a^2+\frac{1}{2}m_c\left( \overbrace{\frac{(m_a +m_c)v_{common}-m_av_a}{m_c}}^{v_c}\right)^2}^{\text{$KE_f$ }} \right)- \left(\overbrace{\frac{ 1}{2}(m_a+m_c)v_{common}^2}^{\text{$KE_i$ }} \right)=m_agh$$

$$KE_f=\frac{1}{2}m_av_a^2+\frac{1}{2}m_c\left( \overbrace{\frac{(m_a +m_c)v_{common}-m_av_a}{m_c}}^{v_c}\right)^2$$

$$KE_i = \frac{ 1}{2}(m_a+m_c)v_{common}^2$$

From This we can Get it
