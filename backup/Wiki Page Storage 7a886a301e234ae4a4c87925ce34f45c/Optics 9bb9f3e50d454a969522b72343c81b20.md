# Lens Maker Formula Derivation ( Thick and Thin )

---

![Optics%209bb9f3e50d454a969522b72343c81b20/Untitled.png](Optics%209bb9f3e50d454a969522b72343c81b20/Untitled.png)

So what will be the difference in a thick and thin lens in deriving the lens formula ?

I think that will be in the $u$ , $v$ , $v_1$ . For the lens the $v_1$ for the first surface is the object distance for the second surface , because theres no distance , but if there were some thickness then the object distance for the second surface would be $v_1 - d$ Which means the second formula would change

$$\frac {\mu_1} v - \frac{\mu_2} {v_1-d}=\frac{\mu_1-\mu_2}{R_2} \tag2$$

$$\frac {\mu_2} {v_1} - \frac{\mu_1} {u}=\frac{\mu_2-\mu_1}{R_1} \tag1$$

Will adding these two help ? It becomes too complex , first lets understand when will we get $f$ , what is the definition of $f$ ? its the point where parallel rays from infinity converge to , so if we make $u=\infin$ then the final image distance $v$ will be the focal length , so  we are going to use $u=\infin$ and $v=f$ 

$$\frac {\mu_1} f - \frac{\mu_2} {v_1-d}=\frac{\mu_1-\mu_2}{R_2} \tag{2'}$$

$$\frac {\mu_2} {v_1} =\frac{\mu_2-\mu_1}{R_1} \tag{1'}$$

Now putting $v_1=\cfrac{R_1\times \mu_2}{\mu_2 - \mu_1}$ in eq $(2')$ we get 

$$\frac{\mu_1}{f}-\frac{\mu_2(\mu_2-\mu_1)}{R_1\mu_2-d\mu_2+d\mu_1}=\frac{\mu_1-\mu_2}{R_2}$$

Wolfram alpha says that , 

$$\frac 1f =(\mu_1-\mu_2) \left[ \frac{(\mu_1d-\mu_2d +\mu_2R_1-\mu_2R_2)}{\mu_1 R_2(\mu_1d-\mu_2d+\mu_2R_1)} \right]$$

The More accepted formula comes when you  take $d(1-\mu) +\mu R_1) \approx \mu R_1$

Then the formula becomes

$$\frac 1f=(\mu-1)\left[ \frac 1{R_1} -\frac 1 {R_2} + \frac{(\mu-1)d}{\mu R_1R_2}\right]$$

But even if i know the formula , it seems the normal lens formual is also not valid for thick lenses 

The formula thats valid for thick lenses are something like 

$$\frac 1{v-t}-\frac1 {u+t}=\frac 1f$$

# Summary of Lenses

There is no lense formula for Fat lenses 

Lens Formula is only for thin lens

You can use this formula if you know the ~~refractive index~~ ~~Focus~~ focal length

The formula is this 

$$\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{v}-\frac{1}{u}$$

SO Hey , where do we get this focal length from ? The refractive index and the radius i suppose ? 

Its called the Lens Maker Formula 

$$\frac 1f=(\mu -1)\left( \frac 1R_1 -\frac 1R_2\right)$$

But this is only for Thin Lenses , What about Thick Lenses ? 

ANyway We should also keep in mind that this focal length can change depending on the following properties 

- Refractive index of the material
- Refractive Index of the medium the material is in
- Both Radius of Curvatures

But then What about Refraction on a curved Surface ? arent Lens also using that ? 

Here is the formual for Refraction on curved surfaces 

$$\frac{\mu_2}{v}-\frac{\mu_1}{u}=\frac{\mu_2-\mu_1}{R}$$

It only needs Radius and Refractive indexes of the two neighbouring mediums right ? Yes 

Then this Refraction of Curved Surfaces is valid for everything curved right ? Cool , this guy is much more general than the lens formula which is only for the thin lens , i wonder how do i find the focal length using the curved surface formula ? For that i guess i have to look at the lens maker formula derivation 

And hence there is another formula : for the focal length of thick lens.

But That formula (The most common) is an approximation , so you can easily find out the formula anytime by urself using the below idea.

 But the idea here is :

> For any system , put $u=\infin$ and find where the final image is , thats the focal point , and taking the distance between the first surface to the focal point is the focal length

Also you can combine two thin lenses when they are in contact using $P_{eq}=p_1+p_2$ but what about Thick lenses in contact ? #Dunno

But there is another formula , For  thin lenses not in contact ! But the formula used in JEE is an approximation , here it is 

$$\frac 1F=\frac 1 f_1 + \frac 1f_2 -\frac{d}{f_1f_2}$$

So after all these lens making , focal length , radius of curvature , I looked at Cutting and Rotating Lenses 

# Cutting Lens

## Cutting vertically

This is important as it makes a Bi-convex lens into a plano-convex lens . Which means one of its radius becomes $\infin$ . Thus doubling its Focal length 

Before Cutting vertically $f=f_o$ , After cutting vertically $f=\cfrac {f_o} 2$ .

You cannot vertically OR horizontally cut a lens into three parts or more , As of now ( at least you cant tell specifically how the focal  length changes )

## Cutting Horizontally

This does not affect neither the radii nor the refractive index of the material . And focal length is only dependent on those two factors , hence there is  no change in focal length 

# Rotating or Tilting lenses

These are very difficult to solve because its lengthy 

When you are going to solve these kind of problem you have to straighten out the principle axis of the lens

Then individually solve for C'A' and D'B' and join A'B' to find the final image , But keep one thing in mind 

The image formed by an object will always be on the line ( joining it and the center of the lens ) because this is where one ray goes through
