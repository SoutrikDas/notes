Lets plot it again

We get that work done is 

$$|W|=V_0\times \frac {P_0}2$$

since this is physics , increase in volume is  +ve Work

Going from 1 to 2 , you cover way more positive area than the negative area you cover due to going from 3 to 4

so option A is correct 

# Option B

The above process only used Isochoric and Isobaric process ( horizontal and vertical lines in PV means these two ) 

so option B is incorrect

# Option C

To calculate $U$ from the equation $\Delta U=nC_v \Delta T$ we need to have $n$ and $C_v$ ( which is just $fR/2$ ). and we are indeed given these pieces of  information 

- $n=1$
- Monoatomic gases have $f=3$ , therefore $C_v=1.5 R$

And we also know from the initial table that $P_0V_0=(1)RT_0$ which means $RT_0=P_0V_0$

From the first law of thermodynamics we know 

$$\Delta Q=\Delta U+\Delta W$$

Now after the table is filled , we can simply take the ratios 

Remember The  Work for the Row $1$ actually means $W_{1\to2}$

option C is correct

# Option D is wrong

you can see from the table
