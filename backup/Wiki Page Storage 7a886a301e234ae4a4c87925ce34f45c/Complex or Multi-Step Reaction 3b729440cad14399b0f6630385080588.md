# When is a Reaction Complex ?

- When a reaction apparently has molecularity $\ge3$ at first glance, It is **FOR SURE a Complex Reaction**
- When a Reaction has Molecularity $\le 3$ then it **MAYBE or MAY NOT Be a Complex Reaction**

---

## Properties of Complex Reaction

1. These Reactions have several Steps 
2. Molecularity for the complex reaction as whole is NOT DEFINED
3. But every step is an elementary reaction , for which Molecularity is defined.
4. **Overall Rate** is given by the Rate of  [Slowest Step](https://www.notion.so/RDS-Rate-Determining-Step-2a3d4e6956d64d1dbf54b95eaab6bfc0) [(RDS)](https://www.notion.so/RDS-Rate-Determining-Step-2a3d4e6956d64d1dbf54b95eaab6bfc0https://www.notion.so/RDS-Rate-Determining-Step-2a3d4e6956d64d1dbf54b95eaab6bfc0) of a Complex Reaction
5. No. of Intermediate $>0$
6. Intermediates **should not appear** in the Rate Law. (Rate Law may have Product , Catalyst but never intermediate )
