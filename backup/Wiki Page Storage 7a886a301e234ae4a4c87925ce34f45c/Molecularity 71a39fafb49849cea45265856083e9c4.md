No of Molecules that **collides together** to give product in the Rate Determining Step of a Reaction 

---

# (Examples)All the following are Elementary Reactions

$$A+B+C\to D \tag{molecularity=3}$$

$$A+A\to B \tag{molecularity=2}$$

$$A \to B \tag{molecularity=1}$$

---

# Maximum Molecularity is **3**

$$A+2B+C \to D \tag{complex reaction}$$

If the Molecularity is **more than 3** then there is very little chance for that reaction to be an Elementary reaction. 

There is a very **high chance** that it is a **Complex Reaction** having lots of elementary reaction ( with their molecularity less than or equal to 3)

The **probability** to have a molecularity more than 3 is very low because it needs proper energy and orientation.

If Molecularity is more than 3 then its not Elementary. But That **doesnt mean** **that All Reactions having less than 3 molecularity are Simple**

## Analogy

A good analogy would be When Making a todo List ,

- [ ]  Finish Alkane (Difficulty 7)

This will be very difficult to do at once 

But if you break it up into chunks like these :

- [ ]  Learn Alkane Nomenclature (Difficulty 1)
- [ ]  Alkane Preperation (Difficulty 2)
- [ ]  Alkane Reactions (Difficulty 3)
- [ ]  Alkane Physical Properties (Difficulty 1)

So Similarly in chemistry if molecularity goes above 4 it becomes so difficult that nature has probably divided that reaction into some smaller simple reactions with less than 4 Molecularity
