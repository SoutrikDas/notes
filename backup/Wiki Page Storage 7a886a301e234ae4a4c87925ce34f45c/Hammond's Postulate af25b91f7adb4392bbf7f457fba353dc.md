Hammonds postulates answers this question "We dont know the shape of a TS , but can we say that it loosk **like** someone ? if we can indeed say so , then how will we determine who does he look like ?"

The activated complex most resembles the adjacent reactant , intermediate or product that it is closest in energy to, as long as the energy difference between the transition state and the adjacent structure is not too large

If you think of the graph ( Energy vs Reaction Coordinate ) as y axis vs x axis 

Where 

- Reactant $(x_r,y_r)$
- Product $(x_p,y_p)$
- Transition State $(x_t,y_t)$

So What hammonds Postulate says is that :

- if $y_t-y_r < y_p-y_t$ then $x_t-x_r < x_p-x_t$

## Pictorial Explanation

If the difference between x cordinates is almost same then the difference between y cordinates ( Energy barrier ) will almost be same

fig 1

If you try to move the peak ( TS ) to the left from where it is in fig 1

then you have to do this

So , if you want to put it to the left , you also have to bring the reactants closer ( in terms of energy) to it.
