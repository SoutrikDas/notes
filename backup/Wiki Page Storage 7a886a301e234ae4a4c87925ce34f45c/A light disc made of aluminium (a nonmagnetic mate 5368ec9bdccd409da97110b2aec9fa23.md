# A light disc made of aluminium (a nonmagnetic material) is kept horizontally and is free to rotateabout its axis as shown in the figure. A strong magnet is held vertically at a point above the disc awayfrom its axis. On revolving the magnet about the axis of the disc, the disc will (figure is schematicand not drawn to scale)

Why will this rotate ? 

From the top ( imagine those dots as magnetic field lines )

As you can see , the magnetic field lines are leaving the imaginary shapes ( you might say that some new magnetic field lines should also enter . Which is correct. 

Let me redraw the scene properly
