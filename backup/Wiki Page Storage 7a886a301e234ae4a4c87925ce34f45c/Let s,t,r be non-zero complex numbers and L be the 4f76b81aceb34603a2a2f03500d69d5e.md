Q.5 Let $s,t,r$ be non-zero complex numbers and $L$ be the set of solutions $z=x+i y$
$(x, y \in \mathbb{R}, i=\sqrt{-1})$ of the equation $s z+t \bar{z}+r=0,$ where $\bar{z}=x-i y .$ Then, which of
the following statement(s) is (are) TRUE?
(A) If $L$ has exactly one element, then $|s| \neq|t|$
(B) If $|s|=|t|,$ then $L$ has infinitely many elements
(C) The number of elements in $L \cap\{z:|z-1+i|=5\}$ is at most 2
(D) If $L$ has more than one element, then $L$ has infinitely many elements

Taking 

$$s=s_1+is_2 \\
t=t_1+i t_2 \\
r=r_1+ir_2$$

$$\left(s_{1}+i s_{2}\right)(x+i y)+\left(t_{1}+i t_{2}\right)(x-i y)+r_{1}+i r_{2}=0$$

$$s_{1} x-s_{2} y+i\left(s_{2} x+s_{1} y\right)+t_{1} x+t_{2} y+i\left(b_{2} x-t_{1} y\right) +r_1+ir_2=0$$

Equating the Real part to 0 and Imaginary part to 0 we get 

$$\begin{array}{l}s_{1} x-s_{2} y+t_{1} x+t_{2} y+x_{1}=0 \\s_{2} x+s_{1} y+t_{2} x-t_{1} y+x_{2}=0\end{array}$$

What to do after this ? What even happens when $|s|=|t|$ ?
