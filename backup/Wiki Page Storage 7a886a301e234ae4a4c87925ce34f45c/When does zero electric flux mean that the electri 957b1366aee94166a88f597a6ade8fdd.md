> Original Question : Are induced charges always on the surface of conducting sphere ?

Whenever there is a charge [article in vicinity there is some induced charge on a charged or non charged conductor

But A hollow non conducting sphere ( charged ) does not have electric field because its charges are on its surface , so when we draw a gaussian surface  inside of it , we see that there is no charge , hence the flux on that gaussian surface will be 0 , from which we can conclude that there is no electric field

Hollow Sphere ( I drew the charges inside the surface but my intention was to show them ON the surface )

So Why in the case of a uniform sphere

If we draw a gaussian surface

This also should give us a zero flux , $\phi_{el}=0$ , so the electric field should also be 0 everywhere inside . 

But if we pick a point inside the conductor , we see that there is a field thats opposing the field of the external charge $q$

So the problem is :

If the induced charges are **only** on the surface , then Electric field inside cannot be 0 . SO is a part of them inside ?

This question really boils down to
