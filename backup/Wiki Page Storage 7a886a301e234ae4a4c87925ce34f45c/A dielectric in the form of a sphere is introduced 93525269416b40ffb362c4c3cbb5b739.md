# A dielectric in the form of a sphere is introduced into a homogeneous electric field. A, B, C are three points as shown in figure.

We know from [Dielectric](Dielectric%20224a5f771d714fb78f404df0bcf63c22.md) that in an electric field a dielectric ( generally a conductor ) seperates into negative and positive charge

 we can think of the negative and positive charges as point charge ( to just understand their effects on A and C )

From this analogy ( this is not really happening ) 

we can understand that  

- field at C increases ( because $\oplus$ has more dominance over $\ominus$ )
- Field at A increases ( because $\ominus$ has more dominance over $\oplus$ )
- field at B decreases ( both $\oplus$ and $\ominus$ work together to decrease intensity )
