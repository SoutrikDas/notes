Major change in the way of study

In school 

- you know what to study
- homework
- know what questions would come

Now 

- have to look for a  lot of answers yourselves

they expect the student to have more expertise than teachers ( after one or two years )

grades are important cgpa >8 

Two fold goal 

- study for grades
- study for becoming expert

You will be doing online classes , dont stop your video and go elsewhere.  It is very important to go through  the lectures.

Resources - NPTEL contains videos about all subjects

TedX and Coursera 

Go and use those resources.

Have to be allround → Good in a subject but also have to be good in communication , also have to be a team player , Bottomline: 

Hone up your english skills .

MK Singh is dean of student welfare

Modular courses are those which you can 

The meeting went downhil with people making the dean angry , so now I have no information , so I will try to email some one who is probably from cs branch and is a girl , because there is higher probablity that a girl will be more serious than a boy . So what is my message going to be ? 

> Hey there,
I am Soutrik Das, cse , section G.We were supposed to have our induction ( or Orientation program ) today from 4pm to 5pm , but it got cancelled halfway through. I am assuming The Orientation program in the morning did not get cancelled.
It would be very helpful if you could share anything that you felt was important in the orientation program you attended today morning.

This is the full list of students with their emails of this year
