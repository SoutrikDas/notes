Given answer is  I>II>III>IV

Lets just remove a hydrogen and see the conjugate bases

sp is more electronegative so stabilizes it more than II

sp$^2$ is less electronegative so it stabilises it less than I

Its a Donor in resonance , so it destabilises

This is also a donor , but it destabilises , less that III

So IV and III are destabilising , so they are the worst acids , now in between I and II , sp wins because it is more electronegative 

So my order of acidic strength is going to be 

$$I>II>IV>III$$

But it is not an option
