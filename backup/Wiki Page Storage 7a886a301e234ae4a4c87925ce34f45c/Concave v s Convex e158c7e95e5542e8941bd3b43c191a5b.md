Okay , in here I am only going to note down one method of selecting if something is concave or convex , if and only if that thing refracts , ie its a lens . The nomenclature of a mirror is not going to be direct , but the opposite of its lens counterpart 

# Basic Nomenclature

> Concave means "hollowed out or rounded inward" and is easily remembered because these surfaces "cave" in. The opposite is convex meaning "curved or rounded outward." Both words have been around for centuries but are often mixed up.

Curving towards you is concave , as it caves

Curving away from you , is convex

So how does this make sense ? 

Lets look at each case one by one 

## Bi-Convex Lens

- A- First surface Curves away hence convex , Second Surface Curves inside hence concave
- B - Both surfaces Concave
- C-First surface concave , second surface convex

Here we see , each point has two verdicts for two surfaces . Instead of that we are going to see only 

A - for left surface 

C - for right surface 

- A- left surface is convex
- C- Right surface is convex

## Bi-Concave Lens

Lets hear the verdicts of A for left surface only and C for right surface only ( remember , A and C both have two verdicts but we will only hear one from each of them ) 

- A- Left surface is concave
- C- Right surface is concave

## Mixed Lens

- **Plano-Convex**  ( This is the only part thats backwards from this convention , is there a reason for that ? Like "Plano" will always be first or something ? ) Even if you flip the lens , it will still remain Plano Convex , But then through our nomenclature will be  A-Plano C-Convex . Which means we can just take the rule that Plano is always first
    - A-convex
    - C-Plano
- Convex-concave
    - A-Convex
    - C-Concave
- Meniscus ?
    - A-Convex
    - C-Concave
- Plano-Concave
    - A-Plano
    - C-Concave
