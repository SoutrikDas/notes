# If we have a conducting sphere and a charge in vicinity , then the spheres center is bound to have some electric field , but conductors ( at equilibrium) dont have electric field in them

A good guess is that , the sphere ( conducting ) somehow rearranges the charges so in order to make potential at any point inside the conductor $=0$
