$$\int \frac{1}{x^3+1} dx$$

~~We can use partial fraction~~ , But maybe thats not a good idea

$$\frac{1}{x^3+1}=\frac{Ax^2+Bx+c}{x^3+1}$$

Maybe we cannot use Partial fraction when there is only one term underneath 

SO what do we do ?

Oh we have to factor out the denominator first 

$$\frac{1}{x^3+1}=\frac{1}{(x+1)(x^2-x+1)}$$

Now we can use Partial Fraction 

$$\frac{1}{(x+1)(x^2-x+1)}=\frac A{(x+1)}+\frac{Bx+C}{(x^2-x+1)}$$
