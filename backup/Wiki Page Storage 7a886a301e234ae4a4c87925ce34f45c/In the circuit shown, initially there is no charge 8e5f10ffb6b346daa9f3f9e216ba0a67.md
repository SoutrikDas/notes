# In the circuit shown, initially there is no charge on capacitors and keys S_1 and S_2 are open. The values of the capacitors are C_1=10 \mu F, C_2=30 \mu F, C_3=C_4=80 \mu F. Which statement(s) is correct?

## Option A

---

Since at $t=0$ the capacitors behave like a conductor , we can just remove them and focus on the circuit 

![In%20the%20circuit%20shown,%20initially%20there%20is%20no%20charge%208e5f10ffb6b346daa9f3f9e216ba0a67/Untitled%202.png](In%20the%20circuit%20shown,%20initially%20there%20is%20no%20charge%208e5f10ffb6b346daa9f3f9e216ba0a67/Untitled%202.png)

So the current is $25mA$ hence option A is correct

## Option B

---

Again we focus on the circuit made by S1

So in the end , the Equivalent capacitors are going to have a total of $5V$ accross them 

Lets try to find the equivalent capacitor 

$$\frac 1 {C_{eq}}=\frac{1\times 8}{10\times 8}+\frac{1}{80}+\frac{1}{80}$$

$$C_{eq}=8 \mu F$$

We know that 

- $C_{eq}=8$
- $V=5$

Using this we can find the charge out 

$$q=CV=40\mu C$$

Now every capacitor will have the same charges accross them 

so the potential of $C_1$is 

$$40\mu C=10\mu F \times ?$$

$$?=4 V$$

Option B is also correct 

## Option C

FOr this we need to find the potential difference between the points $P$ and $Q$

![In%20the%20circuit%20shown,%20initially%20there%20is%20no%20charge%208e5f10ffb6b346daa9f3f9e216ba0a67/Untitled%204.png](In%20the%20circuit%20shown,%20initially%20there%20is%20no%20charge%208e5f10ffb6b346daa9f3f9e216ba0a67/Untitled%204.png)

~~From the above diagram we can see that the $V_P-V_Q=4V$~~ 

The above diagram is totaly wrong 

because There is current flowing ( there is an addition of a new battery ) so there must be some potential difference accross the resistance ( which i neglected )

Which means option C is not correct 

But this KVL method is way long 

# Option D

By mistake I did calculate that the potential difference between P and Q will be $4V$
