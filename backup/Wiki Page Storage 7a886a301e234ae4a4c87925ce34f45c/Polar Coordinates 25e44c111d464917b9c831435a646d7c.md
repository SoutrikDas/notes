The polar coordinate seems simple enough ( atleast for the two dimensions) 

Instead of $(x,y)$ use $( \text{ radial distance },\text{ angle })$

Origin in Cartesian Coordinates is same as Pole in Polar Coordinate

This is what a polar coordinate looks like ,  PS : The -x and the -y doesnt really mean anything in the polar coordinates , they have just been drawn for reference of 90, 180, 270

## Converting Coordinates from Cartesian to Polar

---

Suppose You either have a complex number $(x+iy)$ or a Cartesian coordinate $(x,y)$ 

And if you want to change it into Polar coordinate then here's how 

 Step 1 : Find the radial distance ( Distance of the point from origin )

$$r=\sqrt{x^2 +y^2}$$

Step 2 : Find the angle from x-axis ( x-xis is conventionally the pole in a polar coordinate system , so all angles are written with respect to it )

$$\theta = \tan ^{-1}{\frac yx}$$

So your final Polar Coordinate is going to be $( r, \theta)$ Or $( \sqrt{x^2 +y^2} ,\tan ^{-1}{\cfrac yx} )$ and thats it.

## Converting Curves from Cartesian to Polar

---

- In cartesian coordinates a curve is specified by defining $y$ in terms of $x$
- In polar Coordinates a curve is specified by defining $r$ (Radial Distance from pole/origin) in terms of $\theta$ (angle from the polar axis / x axis)

In cartesian coordinates all points in a curve can be written like $(x,y(x))$ the second being the function of the first. But in case of a Polar Equation its $(r(\theta),\theta)$ the first being the function of the second

## Circle

---

In Cartesian system it was 

$$x^2 + y^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c =0$$

This gives us some information 

- Center at $(-g , -f )$
- the distance b/w its center and any point is always constant
- Radius = $\sqrt{g^2+f^2-c}$

Now to make an equation of a Circle in a Polar coordinate system we just need to somehow the above  pieces of information.

To convey that distance from the center is always constant , first lets assume the pole is the center 

How would we make a circle around the center ? Well we can keep the radial distance same .
