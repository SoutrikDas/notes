- Transition States are more reactive than Intermediates.
- Transition States exists for shorter duration than Intermediates

This reaction can be shown as R → I → P 

All Transition States have higher energy than R I P ( Reactant , Intermediate , Product ) 

When there are two TS ( two hills ) we say that this is a two step reaction .
