This is wrong

On the right Side I wrote that Condition for Lift off is 

$$kx \ge 2mg$$

But this was for diagram 4 , when i was laready using $x$ in diagram 3 . Hence i was getting $h=0$ for bouncing requirement 

Solution is that my COndition of Lift of Should have been 

$$-kx \ge 2mg \\
x=-\frac{2mg}{k} \quad \text{for minimum Condition}$$

Using this we can get the correct value of h , ie 

$$h=\frac{4mg}{k}$$
