# Optical Isomerism

## How to get enantiomer of one compound ?

### Put a mirror behind ( useful if there are dash and wedge )

All you really have to do , is to redraw the carbon skeleton and then switch all dashes to wedges and all wedge to dash

### Put a mirror on the side (useful where wedge and dash are not drawn but implied )

Its also useful when there are wedges drawn

In Fischer projection and chair form of cyclohexane , the wedge and dash are not drawn , rather they are implied ( meaning that the information that was previously being conveyed by wedge and dash , is now conveyed through some other means )

But its main power comes when the wedge and dash are not explicitly drawn but rather implied

## How to identify Meso Compounds ?

---

A meso compound has stereocenters, but the compound also has symmetry
that allows it to be the mirror image of itself

It can also happen when the compound has a center of inversion.

inversion. If we invert everything around the center of the molecule, we regenerate
the same thing.

There is one fail-safe way to tell if a compound is a meso compound: simply draw what you think should be the enantiomer and see if you can rotate the new drawing in any way to superimpose on the original drawing. If you can, then the compound will be meso. If not, then your second drawing is the enantiomer of the original compound
