We have to do `npm init`

to install react and react-dom and babel , babel helps us to convert the JSX( java script and XML ) to   vanilla javascript

what npm init does is it creates a `packages.json` that keeps track of all of our dependencies and using that we are going to install babel 

To install react and react-dom do 

```dart
npm install react react-dom --save 
```

what the `--save` does is save the dependencies under normal dependencies in `package.json`

This is how its going to look 

For the babel ( which is a developer dependency and not something to actually needed to run the website ) 

```dart
npm install babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react --save-dev
```

`--save-dev` saves all these dependencies to dev dependencies

Now lets install webpack ( server for developement ) 

```dart
npm install webpack webpack-dev-server --save-dev
```

Now lets configure it so that webpack.config which is going to control how babel converts the jsx to javascript
