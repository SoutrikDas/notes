This is not a official tutorial , this is just my notes of what I know if Gatsby.js , for the original tutorial go [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/)

[Gatsby Main DB](Gatsby%20js%204075d121dc8c4efc8074cf5678a5048d/Gatsby%20Main%20DB%20b21a3920ee134d5cb7e22d38c689d80e.csv)

# Setting up Development environment

---

- [x]  install node.js
- [x]  install Git

# Gatsby Helloworld

---

```python
gatsby new [SITE_DIRECTORY_NAME] [URL_OF_STARTER_GITHUB_REPO]
```

the above is the general way to make a new site based on any existing starter template . If youomit the url at the end , then gatsby will use a default starter 

```python
gatsby new hello-world https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
```

to create a new gatsby page from some already created materials 

To create gatsby project from nothing ,use this 

```dart
gatsby new <project name>
```

After initialising , it gives the following message 

```python
Your new Gatsby site has been successfully bootstrapped. Start developing it by running:

  cd hello-world
  gatsby develop
```

Start developement 

```python
gatsby develop
```

üí° This command starts a development server. You will be able to see and interact with your new site in a development environment ‚Äî local (on your computer, not published to the internet).

## Getting the plugin `gatsby-file-system` and `gatsby-transformer-remark`

---

Why? Its needed so that gatsby can read files from our system

Why does it want to read files from our file system ? 

Because we want it to read our markdown files and give us some good looking html or react or anything 

So how to install ?

```python
~~npm install gatsby-source-filesystem -g~~
```

~~maybe add in the `-g` to make this global~~

We are installing the remark to transform markdown to html css or something 

![Gatsby%20js%204075d121dc8c4efc8074cf5678a5048d/addgatsbyplugins.gif](Gatsby%20js%204075d121dc8c4efc8074cf5678a5048d/addgatsbyplugins.gif)

You need to install , then add the names to config

There is a problem though , with the path where these plugins get installed , I installed two times , once with `-g` and once inside the project directory , still its giving error when I run `gatsby develop` 

[Their website](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-filesystem/) says to do this 

```python
npm install --save gatsby-source-filesystem
```

Its still showing the same problem 

```python
The path passed to gatsby-source-filesystem does not exist on your file system:
D:\Coding_Projects\Gatsby\hello-worldsrcpages
Please pick a path to an existing directory.
See docs here - https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/
```

It seems the problem was in backslash vs frontslash

```python
`${__dirname}/src/pages/`
# this worked 
`${__dirname}\src\pages\`
# the above was causing the problem
```

## 1 , Components

---

what are they and how are they implemented ?  Components are absolutely similar to [Flutter](Flutter%2089e076858c9b4872bb9294c2e69fb0f8.md) widgets , they are self contained pieces of code with styling and behaviour and also relate to UI 

But how are these components used ? In flutter we make a widget and  then use the 

```dart
void main (
	runApp(<widget> )
)
```

but in react ( or gatsby to be exact) its something like this 

```dart
import React from "react"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div style={{ color: `purple` }}>
      <h1>Hello Gatsby!</h1>
      <p>What a world.</p>
      <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random/400x200" alt="" />
    </div>
  )
}
```

so you have a function that basically is a component ? and it returns html inside of parenthesis ?

```jsx
export default function <Widget name>() {
	return ( <html> )
}
```

Interestingly the code I am using is a bit different 

```jsx
const IndexPage = () => (
  <Layout>
    <h1>Hello There I am soutrik</h1>
    <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random/400x200" alt="BYE"/>
  </Layout>
)

export default IndexPage
```

here I made a function that returns html within parenthesis

```jsx
<Widget name>() { 
	return ( <html> )
}

export default <Widget name>
```

Why isnt it like [this]() ?

```jsx
<Widget name>() { 
	return ( <html> )
}

export default function <Widget name>
```

anyway  the main thing is that  the html goes inside a function ( which is called components and you can reuse them ) 

## Anything inside `src/pages` ie `src/pages/*.js` is an accesible page

Import `Link` from `gatsby` like so 

```jsx
import { Link } from `gatsby`
```

what does that mean , it means if you write any code inside a `js` file in `src/pages` then it will be accessible at `[localhost:8080/<name>/](http://localhost:8080/<name>/)`  for example i made this page `about.js`  and now there is an accessible page at `[localhost:8080/about/](http://localhost:8080/about/)` 

basically in flutter terms it means that you any widget inside pages is accessible with the proper url

the one big difference between flutter app and react app is the fact that the user can navigate if they know the url in the react app , but as for flutter , there is no option to input the url hence the user is completely dependent on the user for  proper routing .

and you can route to them using either 

```jsx
<Link to="/<name>" > Hyperlink text </Link>

OR

<Link to="/<name>/" > Hyperlink text </Link>
```

But why not use the anchor tag that html gives you ?Because its a bit slow 

```jsx
import { Link } from 'gatsby'
import React from 'react'
const IndexPage = ()=> {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello I am soutrik</h1>
      <br />
      <a href="/contact">Contacts anchor tag</a>
      <br></br>
      <Link to="/contact">Contacts Link tag</Link>
    </div>
  )
}

export default IndexPage
```

![Gatsby%20js%204075d121dc8c4efc8074cf5678a5048d/difference_between_anchor_and_link.gif](Gatsby%20js%204075d121dc8c4efc8074cf5678a5048d/difference_between_anchor_and_link.gif)

for the anchor tag , page A disappears ‚Üí you see white screen ‚Üí page B loads 

for the gatsby link tag , page A disappears ‚Üí page B loads 

### Linking to external webpages

---

When I tried 

```jsx
<Link to="www.google.com">Go to google </Link>
```

To link to google , this happens 

![Gatsby%20js%204075d121dc8c4efc8074cf5678a5048d/linking_to_external_webpages.gif](Gatsby%20js%204075d121dc8c4efc8074cf5678a5048d/linking_to_external_webpages.gif)

~~Currently I do not have a solution but use the anchor component for the external webpages~~

The solution is to use `[https://google.com](https://google.com)` instead of `[www.google.com](http://www.google.com)` and this works for both anchor and link components

## Components and reusing them

---

in flutter reusing is pretty easy , you have childrens which can be widgets and thats how you basically reuse it, Instantiate it and put it as a child of another 

```dart
Container(
child: <Reusable Widget name> (),
)
```

Its quite a bit similar in react , define a function , and this is going to be our reusable component  

```jsx
export default function Header() {
  return <h1>This is a header.</h1>
}
```

Then in the file where you want to use it 

Use it like so `< <Reusable widget name> />` 

```jsx
import React from "react"
**import Header from "../components/header"**

export default function About() {
  return (
    <div style={{ color: `teal` }}>
        **<Header/>**
      <h1 style={{color:`red`}}>About Gatsby</h1>
      <p>Such wow. Very React.</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Thats cool and all but how do you pass in parameters so that the widget can be reused for different purposes ? 

and the answer to that is , Since the reusable components are functions , then we can just add a function parameter for it . 

![Gatsby%20js%204075d121dc8c4efc8074cf5678a5048d/parameter_of_reusable_component_react.gif](Gatsby%20js%204075d121dc8c4efc8074cf5678a5048d/parameter_of_reusable_component_react.gif)

In JSX, you can embed any JavaScript expression by wrapping it with `{}`. This is how you can access the `headerText` property (or ‚Äúprop!‚Äù) from the ‚Äúprops‚Äù object.

## 2 : Styling in Gatsby

---

So there is this thing known as global style , why is it global , because it applies to all or most of the pages , just like how most of the websites online have a theme ( like how all gatsby sites have the same font , and theme color of purple and white and black ) 

So how do we apply global styles ? well one way is to add a `.css` file , but where ?

so we make a directory called `styles` inside the `src` folder ( but its entirely up to you ) and then define some css like so 

```css
html {
  background-color: lavenderblush;
}
```

## Shared Components

---

Things that are exactly ( almost ) the same across all ( or some ) of the pages 

An example would be the sidebar in the gatsby tutorial website 

![Gatsby%20js%204075d121dc8c4efc8074cf5678a5048d/shared_components.gif](Gatsby%20js%204075d121dc8c4efc8074cf5678a5048d/shared_components.gif)

For this we do not make a `.js` file in the `src/pages` directory but in the `src/components` directory like so 

The name of the directory need not be `src/components` , it can be anything 

![Gatsby%20js%204075d121dc8c4efc8074cf5678a5048d/new_directory_components.gif](Gatsby%20js%204075d121dc8c4efc8074cf5678a5048d/new_directory_components.gif)

In this file we will define a similar function that returns what we want ( a footer ) with some text 

and in the other pages , we are going to import and use it 

![Gatsby%20js%204075d121dc8c4efc8074cf5678a5048d/footer_component.gif](Gatsby%20js%204075d121dc8c4efc8074cf5678a5048d/footer_component.gif)

Dont forget to `export default Footer` in the `footer.js` ( which I didnt do the first time because I thought it wasnt a page so why would you export it , but it seems you have to export for anything and everything )

With this following code for header I have something like this 

```jsx
import { Link } from 'gatsby'
import React from 'react'

const Header = ()=> {
    return (
        <header>
            <h1>Soutrik</h1>
            <nav>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <Link to="/">Home</Link>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <Link to="/contact">Contact</Link>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <Link to="/about">About</Link>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <Link to="/blog">Blog</Link>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </nav>
        </header>
    )
}

export default Header
```

![Gatsby%20js%204075d121dc8c4efc8074cf5678a5048d/shared_component_header.gif](Gatsby%20js%204075d121dc8c4efc8074cf5678a5048d/shared_component_header.gif)

This way of shared components is a bit tedious because you have to import and add every shared component to every page  ( and in their correct postion  , ie footer in the end and header in the beginning ) , for four pages its ok , but once the number of pages grow  , it would definitely become a pain to edit all the pages for the same thing .

~~So The Page Layout comes into play here . We can make a universal layout for every page !~~

So the layout works in the same way as header and footer , you import it but what is different is this time you pass the contents into the `<Layout>` ( what is layout ? a user defined component nothing else ) 

```jsx
const IndexPage = ()=> {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header/>
      <h1>Hello I am soutrik</h1>
      <br />
      <Link to="/contact">Contacts</Link>
      <br />
      <Link to="/about">About</Link>
      <Footer/>
    </div>
  )
}
```

We want this to be like 

```jsx
const IndexPage = ()=> {
  return (
    <div>
      <Layout>
        <h1>Hello I am soutrik</h1>
        <br />
        <Link to="/contact">Contacts</Link>
        <br />
        <Link to="/about">About</Link>
      </Layout>
    </div>
  )
}
```

So whatever we are passing in to layout can be accessible by `props.children` 

in jsx you access a variable with `{ <var name> }`

![Gatsby%20js%204075d121dc8c4efc8074cf5678a5048d/Layout.gif](Gatsby%20js%204075d121dc8c4efc8074cf5678a5048d/Layout.gif)

Now everything is going from their respective page to layout then back to their respective page 

## Styling in gatsby ( using Layout)

---

So the layout that we made is something every page in our project is using , what does that mean  ? 

Applying something to `layout.js` will automatically apply it to all the other pages 

![Gatsby%20js%204075d121dc8c4efc8074cf5678a5048d/index_css.gif](Gatsby%20js%204075d121dc8c4efc8074cf5678a5048d/index_css.gif)

Thats how you can add global styles I guess

## Sass what is it and gatsby plugin

---

So it is basically 

$$\text{CSS}+\text{ varaibles + if +  functions + inheritance}=\text{SASS}$$

Install it using the following command 

```jsx
npm install gatsby-plugin-sass node-sass
```

then go to  `gatsby-config.js` and here we basically need to export something but since this is node we are going to export it differently 

```jsx
module.exports = { <The thing we want to export > } 
```

In our case we want an array  of plugins ( we only have one but we stil have to use plugin array )

```jsx
module.exports = {
  /* Your site config here */
  plugins: [
    'gatsby-plugin-sass'
  ],
}
```

Then make or change the already existing `.css` file to a `.scss` file
